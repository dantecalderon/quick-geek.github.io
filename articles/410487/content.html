Write her feat by the fact that it was not possible to google the solution in Russian, but found only in English.  So I am writing a Russian version, who can help. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The essence of the problem.  At one point not at all, my Polar H7 pulse sensor (I suppose that what is written is applicable and at least to H6 and H10) stopped connecting.  Those.  He "saw" in the list of devices when searching but the connection did not go. <br><br>  If anyone is interested - from a technical point of view - there was a timeout at the stage of getting the list of GATT services (p_clcb-&gt; operation == GATTC_OPTYPE_DISCOVERY &amp;&amp; p_clcb-&gt; op_subtype == GATT_DISC_SRVC_ALL). <br><br>  At the same time, on low frequencies (5 kHz, if memory serves me), the simulator saw it.  A simple pick-up of the battery (including 10 minutes minutes) did not solve the problem.  The solution was found at some <a href="http://tanster.com/reset-polar-h7-bluetooth-heart-rate-sensor/">bourgeois forum</a> .  You just need to short out the battery contacts in the device for a few seconds after picking up the battery. <br><br>  Later, already knowing what to look for, I found the <a href="https://support.polar.com/en/support/FAQs/Troubleshooting_H7_heart_rate_sensor">“official” recommendation</a> .  It is necessary to remove the battery for 6 minutes and close the contacts within 10 seconds immediately after removing the battery. <br><br>  <i>If you’ve been on the phone for a few minutes, you can’t get it back.</i> <br><br>  Here is such a quest. </div>
