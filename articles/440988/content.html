<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dk/l5/9i/dkl59iflxhwxxrzvrjn-mghxxnk.png"><br><br>  Back in 2015, Google <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/03/13/google_developer_gtld_domain_icann/">caused</a> dissatisfaction with some developers, having obtained the domain zone .dev in its sole use.  Now the situation is <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/2019/02/hello-dev.html">changing</a> , and the opportunity to buy a domain gets any. <br><br>  Well, right now, not quite any: from February 19 to 28, the Early Access Program is operational with an additional fee for registering a domain, reaching up to $ 11,000. But every day the amount will decrease, and from February 28, only the standard payment of $ 12 / year will remain, so it will be suitable not only for large companies, but also for small personal developers about development. <br><br>  A number of companies are already active in the new zone (and it doesn’t even simply mean “set up a redirect”).  Here are some examples: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://web.dev/">web.dev</a> and <a href="https://opensource.dev/">opensource.dev</a> - sites directly from Google </li><li>  <a href="https://github.dev/">github.dev</a> - GitHub here does not redirect to its main page, but offers developers to file a personal website using GitHub Pages </li><li>  <a href="https://ycombinator.dev/">ycombinator.dev</a> - the famous startup accelerator YCombinator gathered together links to its materials for developers </li><li>  <a href="https://slack.dev/">slack.dev</a> - seems to have made a separate site from the page of the main site <a href="https://api.slack.com/tools">api.slack.com/tools</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://jetbrains.dev/">jetbrains.dev</a> - in fact, a <a href="https://jetbrains.dev/">landing page</a> for JetBrains products that you probably already know </li><li>  <a href="https://codecademy.dev/">codecademy.dev</a> - looks like the usual main <a href="https://codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> , but without the “Upgrade to Pro” button.  Trimmed version with only free courses? </li><li>  <a href="https://women.dev/">women.dev</a> - Women Who Code </li><li>  <a href="https://mdn.dev/">mdn.dev</a> - Mozilla's MDN Web Docs </li></ul><br>  For addresses like microsoft.dev or apple.dev, nothing opens, but you cannot get them.  But habr.dev is free for now! <br><br>  Check availability of the domain and go to the purchase, you can use a special website from Google <a href="https://get.dev/">get.dev</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kc/x7/0d/kcx70dzpanixdaezjlky5di00hw.png"><br><br>  It's funny that in the illustration on this site there is an unobtrusive product placement of the column Google Home.  Another nice little thing about the design of the site - at first the animation seems to be just symbolic, but when approaching, you can find that quite real text appears on the laptop screen: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ov/uk/8t/ovuk8tf3zxurc8ergznt-jy9_ce.png"><br><br>  Like the previously opened zone .app, .dev was originally designed for HTTPS: browsers that support <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2017/09/broadening-hsts-to-secure-more-of-web.html">HSTS</a> (including all popular ones) will access all .dev sites via HTTPS only. <br><br>  Previously, addresses with the end of .dev were sometimes used by developers to test their products, but in 2017 <a href="https://medium.engineering/use-a-dev-domain-not-anymore-95219778e6fd">there were problems</a> with the appearance of a domain zone. <br><br>  Well, now let's chop up in the comments: this is “a useful zone, which we have long lacked,” or “another pointless zone, did you live well with .com for the whole row”?  Do you want a domain there?  Do you want companies to start developers-oriented websites there, or is the “for developers” section on the main site quite sufficient?  We are holding conferences for developers, does it seem like a logical .dev zone, or is more than enough for such conference sites? <br><br><blockquote>  Finally a minute of advertising.  Since you are interested in the .dev zone, it looks like you are a developer, and in this case you may be interested in one of our conferences this spring: <a href="https://jpoint.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D440988">JPoint</a> (Java), <a href="https://dotnext-piter.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D440988">DotNext</a> (.NET), <a href="https://cppconf.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D440988">C ++ Russia</a> , <a href="https://holyjs-piter.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D440988">HolyJS</a> , <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D440988">Mobius</a> . </blockquote></div>
