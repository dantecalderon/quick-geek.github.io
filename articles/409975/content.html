The main difference between these controllers and their predecessors is the support of up to two DisplayPort version 1.4 streams, providing connection of 4k @ 120 Hz monitors.  The JHL 7340 (single-port) and JHL 7540 (dual-port) controllers are designed for use in computers, the JHL 7440 (dual-port) model is for peripherals: monitors and docking stations.  An interesting feature of the latter is compatibility with USB;  USB connectivity provides basic functionality, while Thunderbolt provides full functionality. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Recall that in 2017, Intel <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/intel/blog/289601/">announced</a> plans to abandon the collection of licensing fees for the use of Thunderbolt technology by third firms.  Apparently, it is the Titan Ridge family to reap the benefits of the new policy.  Will this affect the popularity of technology? </div>
