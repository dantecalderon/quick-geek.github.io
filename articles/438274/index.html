  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Definition of "toxic personality" in IT</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the <a href="https://habr.com/post/432700/">last article</a> , the author and I came to the conclusion that there is no precise definition of a ‚Äútoxic personality.‚Äù  Therefore, I decided to fill this gap in education and independently formulate this definition. <br><br>  <b>What is the essence of the problem?</b> <br><br>  Regardless of the type of relationship, both parties always believe that they were somehow offended.  For example, the team does not allow a person to express their opinions.  There are 2 possible options: <br><br><ol><li>  The team considers human behavior unacceptable (toxic) </li><li>  The person considers the actions of the collective manipulative (toxic) </li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jf/5l/wr/jf5lwrfsbfuopduhqymhqu8fbqc.png"><br>  Well, who is right?  You can write your opinion in the comments, and I will offer you my own. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First of all, I went through all the first pages in Google for the query ‚Äútoxic person,‚Äù I read everything, digested it, and I had the following definition: <br>  " <u>Toxic personality</u> " - an employee who does not feel part of a team, or divides a cohesive team into parts. <br><br>  The essence of the team is to make <u>joint efforts</u> to achieve a <u>common goal</u> .  And the ‚Äútoxic personality‚Äù turns the work into a fairy tale about a swan, cancer, and pike, so I consider the <u>division of the team</u> into parts its main feature. <br><br>  And now examples.  Poisons that divide the team into parts and antidotes: <br>  (I came up with antidotes myself, if you have better ideas, write in the comments) <br><br><hr><br>  <b>Poison:</b> "I am always right, because I have more experience, but you are not competent and must write code as I write."  ( <u>criticism</u> ) <br><br>  <b>Antidote:</b> ‚ÄúIf you cannot explain why your code is better, then you yourself are not sure about it.  Were sure - they would immediately show how to and say why. ‚Äù <br><br><hr><br>  <b>Poison:</b> ‚ÄúIt is better to speak straight.  A sharp word helps motivate a person to solve a problem faster. ‚Äù  ( <u>waste of time</u> ) <br><br>  <b>Antidote:</b> ‚ÄúIf obscene speech helps to solve a problem more quickly, then why don't you use the same methods when writing SQL queries, for example?  Add there more words to make the database even clearer. ‚Äù <br><br><hr><br>  <b>Poison:</b> ‚ÄúI will still say everything I think about their bug reports!  You just take away my right to free speech, you are manipulators! ‚Äù( <u>Waste of energy</u> ) <br><br>  <b>Antidote:</b> ‚ÄúOur goal is not to limit you to anything, but to create such a product faster and easier.  How exactly do your sayings help other people do their work faster? ‚Äù <br><br><hr><br>  <b>Poison:</b> ‚ÄúThis is just a business.  Survives the strongest. "( <u>Lack of empathy</u> ) <br><br>  <b>Antidote:</b> ‚ÄúAll things in the world are created by groups of people.  If you are sure that you are the strongest of all - you would have done everything yourself a long time ago, why are you wasting our time?  Want to work together - let's negotiate. ‚Äù <br><br><hr><br>  <b>Poison:</b> ‚ÄúIT is not a kindergarten.  You are just sissies, offended.  You are not stress resistant! ‚Äù(Ridicule) <br><br>  <b>Antidote:</b> ‚ÄúWhat kind of stress should our employees struggle with?  With the one you create intentionally with your statements? ‚Äù <br><br><hr><br>  There are still people who give their colleagues false information, or do not share it at all.  I did not come up with an example of poison, but then probably everyone understands that they need to be first identified and fired, because these are direct losses for everyone. <br><br>  So, my verdict: <u>Both are wrong.</u>  <u>The one who, from a position of strength, divides the collective into parts, and the one who defends himself and moves away from the collective, both participants in the relationship are ‚Äútoxic personalities</u> . <u>‚Äù</u> <br><br>  <b>What solutions exist?</b> <br><br>  Robert Sutton suggests not to work with toxic people at all.  And this seems to be the right decision, because it is impossible to rehabilitate a person. <br><br>  I personally think that you need to give a person a chance, or even two.  Perhaps then a person will understand that the strategy ‚Äúan eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth‚Äù makes a profit only in the conditions of the prisoner's paradox, and cooperation is always more profitable in any team.  But, if there are a lot of ‚Äútoxic people‚Äù around, then the only way out is to urgently escape from such a team. <br><br>  Do you agree with my definition of toxicity?  Waiting for your opinions in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/438274/">https://habr.com/ru/post/438274/</a></p>
