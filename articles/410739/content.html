<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Phrasal verbs are one of the most insidious and mysterious topics in the English language.  It is insidious because there are a lot of verbs, they easily enter and leave everyday life, and mysterious - because the majority of verbs can be picked up not just a phrasal, but an ordinary synonym, but at the same time the probability of its use is extremely low.  Phrasal verbs are indispensable in daily communication on any topic, and in the office you will also hear them more than once.  And you often wrote about them in the comments, so we decided that it would be relevant to collect several sets of phrasal verbs on the most pressing topics, today is the first one. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  1. Take on </h3><br>  This is a multi-valued verb, but in the context of the work it needs to be memorized in two meanings: to hire someone (the synonym for <i>hire</i> and <i>employ</i> ) and accept work or duty (the synonym for <i>accept</i> ). <br><br>  Examples: <br><blockquote>  Loot, the company.  I'll send them my CV. <br><br>  I can't take it anymore at the moment. </blockquote><br><h3>  2. Pencil in </h3><br>  It has nothing to do with a pencil, but is related to writing: the verb <i>to pencil in</i> means "pre-arrange (meet)."  If you make an appointment with this verb, you will need to confirm in advance that everything is in force.  A synonym for this verb is the phrase <i>“to set [an appointment, a meeting]”</i> . <br><br>  Example: <br><blockquote>  Let's meet the meeting. </blockquote><br><h3>  3. Call off </h3><br>  Antonym to <i>pencil in</i> , means “undo”.  The synonym is the verb <i>“to cancel”</i> .  It is often used in conjunction with the word <i>“meeting”</i> , for example: <br><blockquote>  The manager is called off today.  I think she'll reschedule it for tomorrow. </blockquote><br><h3>  4. Spell out </h3><br>  Close to the meaning of the verb <i>spell</i> and means "to explain in detail."  Appropriate when discussing plans, proposals, projects and even contracts. <br><br>  Example: <br><blockquote>  I’m getting one. </blockquote><br><h3>  5. Knuckle down </h3><br>  Informal verb, which means "to concentrate and start working", especially if you have previously procrastinated with might and main.  Appropriate when communicating with colleagues, partners, this is better not to write. <br><br>  Example: <br><blockquote>  High time we knuckled down to this project. </blockquote><br><h3>  6. Run out of something </h3><br>  It has no analogues in Russian, because we have a reflexive verb "to end", to which no verb can be found in the actual voice.  For example, we say “Our water in the cooler is over”, and English-speaking employees will say <i>“We ran out of water in the dispenser”</i> .  That is, <i>run out of something is</i> about and means “to end”, only the sentence does not begin with what actually ended.  Instead, in the role of the subject is the one who has something ended, and the object comes after the preposition <i>of</i> .  This verb is very popular among office workers. <br><br><h3>  7. Write down, note down, jot down </h3><br>  You are probably familiar with the verb <i>“write down”</i> , which means “write”.  We offer you two of his synonyms.  Between themselves, they differ only by the meticulousness of the record.  <i>Write down</i> - this is carefully written down or fixed on paper lists or ideas.  <i>Note down</i> - take notes, and <i>jot down</i> - write hastily.  All three verbs can be used when discussing your notes following a meeting. <br><br>  Example: <br><blockquote>  I’ve noted down, but not everything.  I was quite obvious. </blockquote><br><h3>  8. Come up </h3><br>  This verb has a lot of meanings, including a synonym for the words <i>“happen”</i> , “to happen”. <br>  For example, <i>“An emergency came up, and we had to call off the meeting”</i> . <br><br>  In addition, the verb <i>“come up”</i> means “to appear.”  In this case, it is synonymous with the word <i>“arise”</i> .  For example, <i>“After I graduated from college, I waited for the laboratory”</i> . <br><br>  Another meaning of this verb is to be mentioned, that is, <i>“to be mentioned”: “A couple of really interesting points came up during the meeting”.</i> <br><br><h3>  9. Come up with </h3><br>  If the preposition <i>“with</i> <i>” is</i> added to the verb <i>“come up”</i> , then the meaning of this whole construct will be “think of” <i>(think of)</i> .  Most often it goes together with words like <i>idea, plan, solution.</i> <br><br>  Examples: <br><blockquote>  I need you to come up with some sketches for this ad. <br><br>  They are more efficient. </blockquote><br><h3>  10. Sign off on </h3><br>  In fact, it is a synonym for the words <i>“agree”</i> and <i>“approve of something”</i> , only more official. <br><br>  Example: <br><blockquote>  For the next year. </blockquote><br><h3>  11. Shop around </h3><br>  This verb means "ask the price" or "pick up the goods at the best price."  Of course, this verb can be used outside the office.  But if you are working in procurement, and you often need to choose options with an optimal ratio of price and quality, then this verb will be useful to include in your vocabulary. <br><br>  Example: <br><blockquote>  It becomes way too expensive.  If you can find other options. </blockquote><br><h3>  12. Work out </h3><br>  In general, the verb <i>“to work out” is</i> multi-valued.  Here you will both “solve a problem / problem” ( <i>solve</i> ), and “think it over” (akin to one more phrasal verb <i>think through</i> ), and “develop” ( <i>develop</i> ), and “resolve” (about a problem).  And this is only if you look at the working context. <br><br>  Examples: <br><blockquote>  To negotiate out of a compromise. <br><br>  When asked for a dinner of all diners, they were unable to work. <br><br>  Things just didn't work out as planned. </blockquote><br><h3>  13. Take over </h3><br>  Another phrasal verb with many meanings.  In particular, it means “to hold office instead of someone,” “take leadership,” and “come to power,” “take control of something” (for example, if we are talking about buying a small company for another, larger one). <br><br>  Examples: <br><blockquote>  Richard retired. <br><br>  They are slowly taking over it. </blockquote><br><h3>  14. Follow up </h3><br>  An important verb, especially if you are working in the service industry, or simply want to maintain good relations with the client.  After negotiations or a project in Europe and America, it is customary to write or call with a question about how things are going, whether you like everything, whether cooperation is planned for the future, etc.  The verb <i>“to follow up”</i> has gradually moved into the category of nouns and adjectives, and we already have <i>“a follow-up call”</i> and <i>“He texted me with a follow-up”</i> .  Literally, this verb is not translated into Russian, it means something akin to "take the next steps / actions." <br><br>  Examples: <br><blockquote>  Follow up the phone call with a written confirmation. <br><br>  This meeting is a follow-up to the last one. </blockquote><br><h3>  15. Fill in </h3><br>  In the working context, the verb <i>“to fill in”</i> can be considered with two meanings.  The first is “tell” ( <i>to tell someone about something</i> ).  For example, you did not attend the meeting and did not know what was happening there, and ask your colleague to tell.  And the second is “to replace” ( <i>to substitute</i> ), that is, if your colleague is away or on leave, and you respond to his mail, you can feel free to introduce yourself and say that today you are for him. <br><br>  Examples: <br><blockquote>  Can you fill me in on the meeting? <br><br>  Hello, my name is Alice, this week. </blockquote><br><br><h2>  If you want to upgrade English, come to us </h2><br>  Readers of the blog give a <a href="https://puzzle-english.com/prices%3Fcoupon_id%3D36%26pes%3Dgeektimes_phrasalwork_coup">coupon for 500 rubles</a> for the purchase of a subscription, which includes 8 types of training and weekly mailings about English grammar and vocabulary - "Vitaminki" and "Buns". <br><br>  And for unlimited and perpetual access to all features of the site there is an <a href="https://puzzle-english.com/vip%3Fpes%3Dgeektimes_phrasalwork_vip">“All Inclusive” tariff</a> (the discount does not apply). </div>
