<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Friends, 3Dtool is with you!  Today we want to talk about the new 3D-printer from the Spanish company bq Witbox Go.  Last year, news about the printer attracted the attention of many 3D print lovers.  The manufacturing company promised the simplest process of preparing for 3D printing and a reasonable price.  Many were looking forward to the announcement of this device.  The attitude was a bit skeptical.  Therefore, as many things have been stated, which even in more expensive printers are not always successfully implemented. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1m/er/hf/1merhfjjvr1imlprftl_ohknl8e.jpeg"><br><br>  The Witbox Go 3D printer appeared in our office about a week ago and immediately became the focus of attention.  Promotional articles are not deceived - the printer really looks very bright and impressive. <br><br>  It all started with unpacking.  Like all products from bq, the printer is very well packed and leaves no chance for our Russian carriers to damage it in any way. <br><br>  Immediately draws attention to the low weight of the printer - only about five kilograms. <br>  In the office, the printer was carried with one hand.  Witbox Go is made almost entirely of plastic.  But this in no way affected its characteristics. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Appearance </h3><br>  The printer does not have a fully enclosed casing.  The front panel is simply translucent to observe the printing process.  Access to the working area is provided from the sides, which are completely open. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sg/by/l4/sgbyl499shlttod_qoutcjydcic.jpeg"><br><br>  The printer does not have a heated table, and is primarily focused on printing with PLA-plastic.  Therefore, the presence of a fully enclosed housing is not required. <br><br>  The case is made of high quality.  No squeaks, all parts fit perfectly together. <br>  Everyone has seen office equipment from good manufacturers, where every bend, surface texture, and so on?  So at Witbox Go all the same.  Like an ordinary laser printer from any well-known company. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pe/69/se/pe69semx5bwyjjokwvs9g_agau0.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_w/4d/b9/_w4db9sszcbyjtu7-xakh-kut6y.jpeg"><br><br>  One power button and LED indicator. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/i2/vz/pi/i2vzpiri7j6c2inicg5ikqozd-y.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Kinematics </h3><br>  Printer kinematics are based on 8mm shafts.  Despite the current fashion on rail guides, the manufacturer chose shafts.  With such small sizes, this solution provides sufficient rigidity for quality printing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sx/js/wt/sxjswt8ki2gdxlb7gnidmy0ftdu.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/v7/ny/b2/v7nyb2vu-v7dqzvegxm6w-vq9ts.jpeg"><br><br>  All moving parts are hidden inside.  And just do not get to them.  bq has always declared the safety of its equipment.  Therefore, first of all, it is assumed that the printer will be used, including by children.  And therefore, everything has been done for the safety of young engineers. <br>  High quality manufacturing 3D-printer ensures the reliability and dependability of all mechanisms. <br><br>  From what can be discerned, we can conclude that the kinematics is based on the H-Bot scheme.  Coupled with the Bowden Extruder (which we will discuss below), this implies high print quality. <br><br><h3>  Extruder </h3><br>  The printer uses a bowden extruder.  Compact size and light weight have a positive effect on print quality and speed. <br><br>  As a feed mechanism, the well-proven DDG (Double Drive Gear) scheme is used, which is used in the Witbox 2 printer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pe/69/se/pe69semx5bwyjjokwvs9g_agau0.jpeg"><br><br>  The extruder is assembled in a closed case - again, according to the requirements of safety and maintenance of appearance. <br><br>  Naturally, it is equipped with a model blowing system, since the main material is PLA.  And then without blowing the details anywhere.  This, by the way, is the only cooler in the printer.  In the case they are not. <br><br><h3>  Desktop </h3><br>  The glass platform has no heating and is mounted on magnets in a niche on the lifting table. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/x1/mb/np/x1mbnpwqertddpkku9orffsqiji.jpeg"><br><br>  The surface itself is made using an adhesive material (something similar is used in Makerbot), and therefore the part sticks to the surface without any problems. <br><br>  No need to bother using any varnishes and adhesives to keep the part on the table. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lu/ev/wq/luevwqqqnxntxxxp5reirwhqzm0.jpeg"><br><br>  It is very easy to pull out the work surface from the printer, remove the part and install it back. <br>  The table itself is equipped with a convenient auto-calibration system. Therefore, the user will not be puzzled by the problem of how to calibrate the table.  Everything is automated. <br><br><h3>  Package and instructions </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gs/iq/ve/gsiqvejclt9mx_ygcjzpm9nz1hu.jpeg"><br><br>  The printer includes: <br><br><ul><li>  3D printer Witbox Go! </li><li>  Reel 1.75mm PLA 300g </li><li>  Table for printing </li><li>  EU-USA Power Adapter </li><li>  USB - micro USB cable </li><li>  Printed sample </li><li>  Putty knife </li><li>  Quick Start Guide and Warranty </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xk/gi/b9/xkgib9bosmhhkdqam08qh0z3n0m.jpeg"><br><br>  The instructions, like all bq 3D printers, are very simple and straightforward.  In her step by step with the help of pictures shows the order of actions.  A person who is far from 3D printing, acting according to this instruction, will easily print the model he likes. <br><br><h3>  Plastic </h3><br>  The question of plastic worried most of the people interested in the printer.  The manufacturer immediately stated that the coils will be completed with RFID tags, in addition, they themselves are of non-standard size 300g.  There was a fear that this non-standard size and labels would be analogous to chip cartridges for inkjet printers.  That is, the printer can only use branded plastic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fd/m5/gh/fdm5ghd8r7u4od90c_ao7wexs4m.jpeg"><br><br>  BQ immediately stated that plastic could be used by any manufacturer and we did not fail to check it out first. <br><br>  We did not have to sing the famous song of BG, because the producer did not deceive us.  Indeed, we easily took the coil of PLA-plastic from REC.  We refueled the filament and began to print. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sv/bi/a8/svbia8z8pfbgt61xtbjir6eygru.jpeg"><br><br>  Since the standard coil is larger, I had to use an additional device.  For future users of the printer this will not make any inconvenience, you can make a similar plastic feeder. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ki/dj/m3/kidjm3vz6ietzskn-nrc1w3gabe.jpeg"><br><br>  There are many models of coil holders.  And the user can print the details on the same Witbox Go.  The RFID tag, as promised by bq, is used to read color parameters, plastic residues in the coil, for ease of use.  This fear of happiness turned out to be dispelled. <br><br><h3>  Electronics and various services </h3><br>  The printer is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 processor and is equipped with 8 GB of memory.  The system uses Android. <br><br>  This made it possible to use various control services in the printer, which not all 3D printers of a higher price category have. <br><br><ul><li>  Thread termination sensor </li><li>  Nozzle clogging sensor </li><li>  Print table sensor </li><li>  Automatic calibration </li><li>  Noise Suppression - Trinamic TMC5130 Engine Drivers </li></ul><br>  On the first two points, everything is clear.  The printer will not crawl with an extruder if the thread runs out, or for some reason a blockage occurs.  Fortunately for us, nothing like this happened, so it was not possible to test this possibility. <br><br>  A table sensor is needed so as not to start the printer to print if we have a table removed.  We remind you that the printer is aimed at an unprepared user or even children.  And they can ... In general, straws are planted everywhere. <br><br>  We already wrote about automatic calibration above.  It saves time and nerves.  According to our statistics, platform calibration is one of the most common questions from people who have just started using a printer. <br><br>  Noise reduction is also given a lot of attention.  It is assumed that the printer will be nearby, on the desktop.  Or simply in an ordinary apartment, for example, in a children's room.  Therefore, he makes a little noise. <br><br>  As interfaces, the printer uses a mini-USB connector.  But the main thing is Wi-Fi.  The printer can be controlled both from a laptop or using a regular Android smartphone.  Due to the presence of internal memory does not require the installation of an SD card.  The model file is uploaded to the printer’s internal memory via Wi-Fi, resulting in fully autonomous 3D printing. <br><br>  Also, thanks to the wireless connection and the Android system, the principle of auto-updating the printer’s firmware via the Internet, like in ordinary smartphones, is implemented. <br><br><h3>  Software </h3><br>  Zetup software specially designed for this printer is used as PC software. <br><br>  It supports remote control.  It also has integration with the MyMiniFactory service.  On this service, you can select your favorite model and immediately send it to print. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lg/5h/pv/lg5hpvi8umc_tcfbftrhzx5hibq.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gq/nl/5p/gqnl5pa3wlvndzmbbl8f_jhkc-e.png"><br><br>  The program is very simple, with a minimum of settings.  From the main - print quality and percentage of filling. <br><br>  According to the manufacturer, you can use popular programs like Cura, but we have not tested them.  Therefore, as we had Zetup.  He fully ensured the principle of Plug and Print, which the manufacturer declares. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/di/ko/e4/dikoe4ruwqgucq0dpa2x86wj-z4.png"><br><br>  In addition to the desktop software, we also tested the mobile version for Android. <br>  There, too, everything is simple and clear. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/s0/5h/5e/s05h5er2lbqgkxrbqqsbzzmz2he.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_y/fk/tm/_yfktm6ojeijmm7jeeqzf6wqimg.png"><br><br>  In the same way we find the printer on Wi-Fi.  Connect and work.  The software is made as simple and clear as possible for the person who first saw the 3D printer.  Currently, mobile software is only for Android.  The program for iOS promise to release in the second half of this year. <br><br><h3>  Print </h3><br>  All that we have said before about the design, theoretically a good kinematic scheme, simple software designed for beginners is certainly good and interesting.  But everyone is interested in how he prints all the same. <br><br>  How many we have seen before the printers that were trying to create on the principle - pressed the button and the printer prints, everything ended quite sadly.  Yes, they could issue a stable print.  But the quality was not so hot.  We, too, were skeptical of the manufacturer’s claims. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Jezu_Mt23s" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  But as in the case of plastic, they were deceived. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ti/to/i0/titoi0d-yipphqmb7zxpbdhoymm.jpeg"><br><br>  This is the result that the printer produced the first time, when printing with “non-native” plastic. <br>  Despite some blots, a very decent print result the first time, with basic settings.  There are, of course, devices that can produce better results, but they are more expensive and require customization for printing. <br><br><h3>  findings </h3><br>  What about Witbox Go?  Hopes and statements of the manufacturer did not deceive.  And at the exit we have a device that can adequately print out of the box and does not require any special knowledge. <br><br>  Yes, it has not the largest size of the printed area 140 * 140 * 140 mm (which is not bad, by the way, considering its compact dimensions).  Limited print settings (although prints on them with dignity).  But at the same time, it has a recommended price of 55,000 rubles, which is slightly compared to other printers with similar characteristics (size of printed area, print quality). <br><br>  The printer really follows the “print out of box” principle.  Maybe, of course, experts of the 3D-printing will not be impressed by its capabilities.  But for a beginner, entry into 3D printing will be as simple and comfortable as possible. <br><br>  For various educational institutions Witbox Go is an excellent choice.  Simple and secure. <br>  With the price, as on top models of smartphones, it will also be an excellent gift for the interested person. <br><br>  Who wants to get acquainted with the 3D printing, while he does not have time to delve into, or because of age can not master the wisdom of the settings, the <a href="http://3dtool.ru/product/3d-printer-witbox-go/">Witbox Go 3D printer</a> is a great choice! </div>
