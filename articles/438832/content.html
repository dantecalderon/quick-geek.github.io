I'm not kidding. <br><br>  However, I could not write a simple instruction (or even simpler to make a calculator) on estimating these costs: for this you will have to take into account too many parameters.  Therefore, I will simply show with examples the circulation and price.  Yes, you can not accurately assess your project, but it will be clear how much money you need - 100,000 rubles, a million or more. <br><br>  And if you write in the comments exactly what interests you, I will try to answer with examples: I have a lot of them (from) a great number - from the cases of miniature devices to the cases of machines the size of a house. <br><br><h2>  I.

This includes the presence of marks in the mold, and inclines, and unclipped welds, etc.  But you can roughly estimate.  :) </div>
