The growth rate was 70%, which is more than enough to be glad for the progress. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Other December 2018 sales reports can be found <a href="https://insideevs.com/tag/sales-december-2018/">here</a> . <br><br>  Thanks to the great end of the year, the 2018th was completed with an indicator of 2 million sales!  Estimates indicate 2,018,247 units, which is 72% more than a year ago, with an average market share of 2.1%. <br><br>  Electric vehicles with a battery accounted for 69% of sales, while the plug-in hybrids sold 31%.  This advantage of electric vehicles with a battery has not been since 2011. <br><br>  Next year, sales are expected in the region of 3-3.5 million units, with a possible record month of 500 thousand units. <br><br>  Worldwide sales of plug-in electric cars, December 2018 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tg/us/da/tgusdace_ujkemir6hb0iwdqdha.png"><br>  <i>* The picture is clickable, but the transition will reset new messages if you click back</i> <br><br>  Other reports: <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://insideevs.com/us-plug-in-electric-car-sales-charted-december-2018/">Sales of plug-in electric vehicles in the USA (with charts): December 2018</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://insideevs.com/2018-passenger-plug-in-cars-registered-europe/">In 2018, over 386 thousand plug-in electric vehicles were registered in Europe</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://insideevs.com/china-180000-plug-in-ev-car-sales-december/">China is surprised by sales of 180 thousand connected electric vehicles in December 2018</a> <br><br>  <b>Model ratings</b> <br><br>  The undisputed leader in 2018 was <a href="https://insideevs.com/tag/tesla-model-3/">Tesla Model 3,</a> with record numbers in December 2018 of 25,050 units, and for the year of 145,846. No other model among electric vehicles (even among the plug-in hybrids) even achieved results. which showed Model 3. <br><br>  We are very grateful to all those who were involved in the Tesla Model 3 (and in general to Tesla), electric vehicle enthusiasts for what they did and indicated the way for the entire automotive industry.  Good luck and hope for 300 thousand units sold in 2019! <br><br>  The following 2 places were taken by the Chinese BAIC EC-Series (90 637) and <a href="https://insideevs.com/tag/nissan-leaf/">Nissan LEAF</a> (87 149) - both models with record numbers.  For the first time since 2014, the Nissan LEAF showed record sales when 61,013 units were sold.  There are also good prospects for growth in sales of these two models in 2019. <br><br>  <a href="https://insideevs.com/tag/tesla-model-s/">Tesla Model S</a> (50 045) and <a href="https://insideevs.com/tag/tesla-model-x/">Tesla Model X</a> (49 349) supplemented the top five plug-in electric cars for the year.  3 models from Tesla - in the top five. <br><br>  BYD distinguished itself with 5 models in the 20th, which consists of 3 models from the USA, 3 models from Europe and 3 from Japan (the remaining 11 models are from the PRC). <br><br>  We hope that in 2019 there will be even more models that will be sold in the amount of more than 10 thousand per month. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ve/iq/gk/veiqgkpsjc0zk5gquskupym7b5o.png"><br>  <i>* The picture is clickable, but the transition will reset new messages if you click back</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/f9/js/3w/f9js3wd-qkvi_ispxxjhe-koyia.png"><br>  <i>* The picture is clickable, but the transition will reset new messages if you click back</i> <br><br>  <b>Manufacturers Ratings</b> <br>  The competition of manufacturers of connected electric vehicles <a href="https://insideevs.com/category/tesla/">Tesla</a> won against <a href="https://insideevs.com/category/byd/">BYD</a> , while the latter - the only company was able to maintain the growth rate of Tesla.
