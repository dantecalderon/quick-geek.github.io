  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IT giant leaves chip market for data centers - tell you what it means for the industry</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The latest Qualcomm ARM chip for data centers - Centriq, came out a little over a year ago and gathered a lot of positive feedback at the start.  But in mid-December, the IT giant <a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/3327214/data-center/qualcomm-makes-it-official-no-more-data-center-chip.html">announced</a> that it was closing the line that deals with manufacturing processors for the data center. <br><br>  We describe the reasons for such a decision and how it will affect the industry as a whole. <br><br> <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/it-grad/blog/436688/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/is/ru/x2/isrux2j0a-y3rg6r-wre7q7ip2e.jpeg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>/ photo by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/marcostetter/34193907632/">Marco Brandstetter</a> PD</i></font> <br><br><h2>  End of the path for Centriq </h2><br>  Qualcomm <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davealtavilla/2017/11/08/qualcomm-launches-disruptive-48-core-centriq-server-processors-targeting-intels-bread-and-butter">released</a> the Centriq ARM processor in November 2017.  The chip had great potential in the data center market: it was several times cheaper than Intel's flagship models, had similar performance and less power consumption. <br><br>  These advantages then came to taste to cloud providers, and Microsoft <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/03/08/microsoft_windows_server_qualcomm/">introduced</a> support for Centriq chips in Windows Server.  The company also planned to install Qualcomm processors in its own data centers.  At the same time, Alibaba and HPE expressed interest in the device, who announced a possible collaboration with Qualcomm. <br><br>  Despite the advantages over competitors and the interest of large market players, the processor never took off.  In December, Qualcomm <a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/3327214/data-center/qualcomm-makes-it-official-no-more-data-center-chip.html">announced</a> that it significantly reduces investment in the development of chips for the data center and reduces almost three hundred employees. <br><br><h2>  Reasons for failure </h2><br>  One of the reasons why Qualcomm turns off work on its chip is the high popularity of x86 processors.  The transition to the ARM-architecture <a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/3273006/cpu-processors/what-qualcomms-rumored-exit-from-data-centers-means.html">will require the</a> processing of software code for applications that run on data center servers. <br><br>  Not all companies are willing to take that risk.  For this reason, Qualcomm could not find a sufficient number of clients for the device.  The lack of orders is <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/news/report-qualcomm-may-give-up-on-arm-servers/">evidenced by</a> the fact that the IT giant has never mentioned Centriq in its financial reports. <br><br>  The second reason <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2018/05/10/what-qualcomms-exit-from-arm-server-chips-means/">is related</a> to the struggle of Qualcomm for its own independence.  At the end of 2017 and the beginning of 2018, Broadcom Singapore tried to absorb the company several times.  The deal did not take place because of the ban of the US government, but investors still Qualcomm worried about the future of the organization and questioned its viability. <br><br>  Shareholders demanded that management cut a billion dollars in expenses.  Therefore, Qualcomm decided to allocate less money for "non-core" areas, <a href="https://thestack.com/data-centre/2018/12/13/qualcomm-data-centre-dreams-will-soon-be-a-distant-memory/">among which were</a> chips for the data center. <br><br><h2>  Market outlook </h2><br>  Representatives of the company itself say that in the future Qualcomm will focus on devices for 5G networks and peripheral computing.  In this case, the company is not going to completely abandon the chips for data centers.  Centriq technology <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/06/14/qualcomm-isnt-quitting-the-server-business-after-a.aspx">will be developed</a> in China under the <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/qualcomm-server-chip-exit-china-centriq-2400,38223.html">brand</a> Thang Long in collaboration with Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent. <br><br>  It is not yet known how the Qualcomm decision will affect its Western customers.  The device was <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/11/08/qualcomm_centriq_2400/">tested by</a> several large IT companies, including LinkedIn, Uber, Cloudflare and Red Hat, but it is unclear which of these organizations have already implemented Centriq in their data centers.  A new supplier of processors may have to look for at least two companies: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tiriasresearch/2018/02/20/hatch-qdt-cloud-gaming">the</a> Hatch Entertainment gaming cloud <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tiriasresearch/2018/02/20/hatch-qdt-cloud-gaming">platform</a> and the <a href="https://www.solarflare.com/Media/Default/Qualcomm/Solarflare_Software_Defined_NIC_Fabrics_Qualcomm_Centriq_Brief.pdf">provider of</a> SDN solutions for the Solarflare data center. <br><br>  In this case, the benefit of leaving Qualcomm from the market of server processors, surprisingly, has gained Microsoft.  The company <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/news/qualcomm-lay-269-staff-primarily-its-data-center-business/">hired</a> most of the employees who lost their jobs due to the closure of the Centriq project.  Among them are the heads of units.  At Microsoft, former Qualcomm engineers will work on quantum computers, which is likely to help the IT giant get ahead in this market. <br><br><h2>  How are other market players doing? </h2><br>  According to experts, processors from other manufacturers, in particular Cavium, can become a replacement for Centriq.  She released her ARM chip Thunder X2 in 2018, and the device is already in demand in supercomputers.  The refusal of Qualcomm to develop Centriq may be an opportunity to increase the popularity of Thunder X2 in other areas. <br><br>  In the fall of 2018, a startup Ampere <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/news/ampere-launches-arm-based-cpu-hyperscale-workloads/">introduced</a> its first product - an ARM processor for hyper-scalable data centers.  Huawei is also counting on this architecture: the company has <a href="https://syncedreview.com/2018/12/21/huawei-announces-new-ai-computing-strategy-unveils-worlds-first-7nm-arm-data-centre-chip/">developed a</a> 7-nm processor that will be used to build cloud systems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/s_/ul/d2/s_uld2vsvbztxbqxlpeevowgnby.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>/ photo <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/vintage_illustration/46351366241/">Rawpixel Ltd</a> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC BY</a></i></font> <br><br>  Keep up with ARM manufacturers and developers of other architectures.  For example, AMD <a href="https://gfxspeak.com/2018/12/12/horizon-dawns-processor/">introduced the</a> 7-nm processor Epyc Rome, which will be the first of all the company's devices to use Zen 2. It will help to increase processor performance by 25% with the same power consumption as the chips of the previous generation. <br><br>  IBM developed the 7nm processor in conjunction with Samsung.  The device will be used in the IBM Z cloud service, as well as in LinuxOne servers.  According to IBM, the new processor is designed to work with machine learning technologies and will be released in 2020. <br><br>  Cloud computing is one of the main drivers of the development of the processor market.  And ARM-chips (even with the departure of Qualcomm) have every chance to capture a significant market share.  Recently, a new rebranding was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/moorinsights/2018/10/17/arm-launches-neoverse-five-things-to-know/">conducted</a> for architecture - the new technology was named Neoverse. <br><br>  Its task is to integrate data centers and peripherals into the ecosystem, many of which are based just on ARM chips.  It is <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2018/10/16/a-new-datacenter-compels-arm-to-create-a-new-chip-line/">believed</a> that thanks to this, in the coming years, ARM will be able to press its competitors. <br><br><hr><br>  What we write about in the corporate blog: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/tendencii/zscaler-novaya-zashhita-dorozhnogo-voina/">Zscaler.</a>  <a href="https://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/tendencii/zscaler-novaya-zashhita-dorozhnogo-voina/">New protection "road warrior"</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/tendencii/vmworld-europe-2018/">VMworld Europe 2018 - the main announcements of the last conference</a> </li></ul><br>  Posts from our Telegram channel: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://t.me/iaasblog/187">IT architecture of the future - who prepares for it and how</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://t.me/iaasblog/178">Why do we need super tiny computers</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://t.me/iaasblog/176">Where are supercomputers used now?</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/436688/">https://habr.com/ru/post/436688/</a></p>
