Something you can take, slightly choking the toad.  Add something to your wish list, or give it to others as possible gifts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fg/ax/uw/fgaxuwufzsxqggp9-4r6fqw0fk0.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the near future, the usual bustle with a choice of gifts for loved ones.  And in order not to donate another unnecessary thing, pay attention to inexpensive and useful gadgets.  Well, maybe not all useful, but, but interesting! <br><br>  Recently, very popular desktop hobby and DIY accessories have become available, but also quite affordable. <br><br>  A good option for a gift is a powerful desktop laser engraver with bluetooth. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/3d-printers-3d-printer-kits/pp_466795.html%3Flkid%3D19090481">NEJE DK - BL1500mw 550 x 550 Pixel Laser Engraver</a> . <br>  It can be connected to a computer, laptop, tablet or smartphone and run the burning program on the surface of objects.  You can make a memorable inscription on the USB-drive, you can - on the box or packaging, etc. <br><br>  Pay attention to another option, cheaper, without bluetooth <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/3d-printers-3d-printer-kits/pp_009994902085.html%3Flkid%3D19090481">NEJE DK - 8 - KZ 1000mW Laser Engraver Printer</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kh/py/54/khpy54jn7ghbagltdsacptujcx0.jpeg"><br><br>  CNC laser engraver is suitable for a hobby or small business, for independent research, just for yourself - you can engrave on small objects at home without unnecessary problems. <br><br>  If you want more interesting and unusual - pay attention to the unusual desktop <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/science-discovery-toys/pp_009179167568.html%3Flkid%3D19090481">model of the Stirling engine (functional model)</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vk/z1/dg/vkz1dg9trsmv9f47yr19jlvc-wa.jpeg"><br><br>  This model can be an interesting souvenir on the office desk, or it can come in handy as a desktop manual in physics and thermal processes.  In any case, the model is operational, the engine is driven by heating a small spirit lamp. <br><br>  If you want more DIY, then the range includes inexpensive robotic mechanisms and platforms for assembling robots and machines. <br><br>  For example, a <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/rc-robot/pp_009710562998.html%3Flkid%3D19090481">simple and inexpensive robo-arm (4 servos)</a> . <br>  There is a more interesting option - a <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/science-discovery-toys/pp_009997949855.html%3Flkid%3D19090481">6-axis robotic arm-grip</a> that can be programmed based on your skills and needs. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/science-discovery-toys/pp_009931712109.html%3Flkid%3D19090481">DIY car assembly platform</a> - perfect for working out control and movement algorithms on a mobile wheeled platform. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/he/ia/c7/heiac7orlnxylb2jwvtdeqzl2t4.jpeg"><br><br>  On such kits, you can work out any ideas, implement a useful device (robot assistant), can be used as part of a course project or a thesis, and also just to ‚Äúkill‚Äù time. <br><br>  If you have a car, it makes sense to look at useful auto-gadgets, for example, <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/car-charger/pp_009450988912.html%3Flkid%3D19090481">battery-Jump Starter (model TM19B)</a> .

Excellent option for completion (painting). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ww/4x/y5/ww4xy5ulpfg0vyxkapngyfrhwtq.jpeg"><br><br>  There are a number of useful and sought-after gifts that can be universal, regardless of profession and preference.  In particular, these are knives, multitools and tools.
