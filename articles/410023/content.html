<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There are many solutions for different tasks and budgets in the line of graphics stations Dell Precision.  Today we want to talk about one of the most unusual computers in this model range - 27-inch monoblock <a href="http://www.dell.com/ru/business/p/precision-5720-aio/pd">Precision 5720 All-in-One</a> . <br><br>  This is one of the most powerful machines in this form factor on the market: Intel Xeon E3-1275 v6 processor, professional graphics Radeon PRO WX7100, up to 64 GB RAM and three drives for data storage can be installed inside.  Add here a great 4K-display with excellent color reproduction, interesting design, powerful built-in audio system, upgradeability (no, this is not a joke) plus the traditional advantages of any monoblock (compact dimensions, minimum wires), and we get a very attractive gadget for working with video and graphics .  But first things first.  Welcome under the cut! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/d_/6k/v3/d_6kv3r9yp_mpqqtkl8_wpck6nw.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#3183c1">Interesting design and great audio</font> </h2><br>  Perhaps the phrase “fat monitor” is the first thing that comes to mind when it comes to monoblock computers.  Globally, of course, this is how it turns out, but there is room for good design decisions here.  The Dell Precision 5720 All-in-One is a clear confirmation of this. <br><br>  Even standing next to the famous aluminum competitor from Cupertino, the monoblock Dell is not completely lost against its background.  And more than that: in something it surpasses it.  The dimensions are roughly comparable, but the thickness of the frames around the display is an order of magnitude less - the experience of developing Infinity Edge screens for UltraSharp monitors and XPS laptops in action. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4c/zv/bm/4czvbm4arjmtguzihdrfh7ec6qw.jpeg"><br><br>  The space on the wide panel below the display is used wisely, and not just to place the logo.  In addition to it, there are a dual camera and 6 speakers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/av/a5/v8/ava5v8sexzx0agzaoy6bgmovh68.jpeg"><br><br>  If the body of the monoblock is slightly raised up and look under it, then there you will see another grate, under which 4 additional speakers are hidden.  In total, there are 10 of them (two for high frequencies, four wideband for low and medium, two passive for low and two independent wideband for volume), and they produce a wonderful sound. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/j7/0g/nx/j70gnxz6fbiy1bglxecdeobruge.jpeg"><br><br>  No optional external speakers Precision 5720 are absolutely not needed: for games, for video, and for music, the capabilities of the integrated audio system are more than enough.  The volume reserve is such that at the maximum level it becomes difficult to be in the average room of a Moscow apartment.  A comfortable level is about 20-30%, and there is no talk about distortions and artifacts of speech on it, of course.  Low frequencies are good, while they do not put pressure on the upper and middle range - the sound is quite clear.  In general, if you are not an audiophile, then it will be difficult to find fault with something. <br><br>  All the main elements of the monoblock - the frame around the display and most of the legs holding it - are made of metal.  The back cover is plastic.  In terms of the practicality of problems with all this does not occur - the colors are dark, almost everywhere there is a matte finish, on which fingerprints are not visible.  Only the panel with speakers under the monitor is glossy, but there is no everyday need to touch it with your fingers, so usually it stays clean. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6d/md/bl/6dmdblsd9n-tti5hef1c4gsr7-8.jpeg"><br><br>  If the user's table is close to the wall, and he wants to push the Precision 5720 as far away from him as possible, then the distance from the wall to the display will be slightly less than 17 centimeters.  The stand is reliable - it has a large area, and 11 kilograms of weight are pressing on top of it.  The computer will not turn over and will not fall even if it is accidentally touched. <br><br>  The monoblock monitor can be raised up to 60 degrees.  Plus, of course, instead of the standard stand, you can use a VESA mount and hang the Precision 5720 All-in-One directly on the wall. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/e8/og/vr/e8ogvrjxv2j88lext50wy_seibc.jpeg"><br><br>  We finish the story about the appearance of the device with a quick overview of the available ports.  On the left side are the SD-card reader and audio input for headphones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wa/pk/ye/wapkyead5or8mg3ur548ja1pdhe.jpeg"><br><br>  On the right is a small backlit power button and a USB 3.0 connector. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zx/zm/ge/zxzmgetmn_dvynx1iu4qzmyomky.jpeg"><br><br>  Everything else is on the back panel.  There are two Thunderbolt 3 for connecting additional monitors, RJ-45 for wired Internet (although the built-in Wi-Fi receiver is also available, of course), audio output for external devices, HDMI, DisplayPort 1.2 input and 4 more USB sockets for peripheral electronics.  A lot of ports, and it is very cool. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nm/pf/ol/nmpfoll_q8igmercxfr2vydrshu.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#3183c1">Universal mouse and comfortable keyboard</font> </h2><br>  The Dell Precision 5720 All-in-One comes with a mouse and keyboard.  In the case of a basic computer configuration, they are wired.  Three-button mouse is simple and minimalist, but convenient and practical in everyday work.  The case has a pleasant to the touch matte finish, the fingerprints on it are barely noticeable.  The wheel is rubberized and rather strongly protrudes upwards.  An additional bonus is the symmetrical form.  Regular users do not care, but for left-handers - a real salvation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/e3/qe/lk/e3qelkf7rqzzi_fj1w6a5wuer0o.jpeg"><br><br>  The keyboard is also dark and matte - full-size.  Buttons by the standards of island-type keyboards protrude up high enough, the stroke is long, the recoil is soft.  Of course, everyone has their own individual preferences, but it seemed to us that it is well suited not only for typing, but even for games.  At the domestic, not professional e-sports level, of course. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zm/yn/qa/zmynqa-jzsv-ts_hs0zxre2q-gy.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#3183c1">4K-display, which is ideal for working with graphics and video</font> </h2><br>  The gorgeous 27-inch screen with a resolution of 3840x2160 pixels is perhaps one of the main advantages of the Dell Precision 5720 All-in-One.  It is beautiful not only because it gives a really huge space for placing several windows at once or conveniently setting up the interfaces of programs for working with graphics, video or 3D models, but also for its excellent color rendering. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/f6/hm/rm/f6hmrmqethlaj8uvsndfgziarqq.jpeg"><br><br>  The color gamut covers 100% of the Adobe RGB range, so the Precision 5720 All-in-One is great for working very hard with graphics: from processing photos in Photoshop to creating print layouts where color accuracy is most important. <br><br>  At the same time, there is always a convenient pre-installed Dell PremierColor program at your fingertips.  It allows you to adjust the brightness and color temperature, but the main thing is the presence of six finely tuned color profiles, among which three are particularly interesting.  Cinema (DCI-P3) is useful for editors and computer graphics specialists, and Internet (sRGB) and Photo (Adobe RGB) for those involved in image processing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/eq/97/ka/eq97kazg-1gddam4yxqejk-yvys.png"><br><br>  Of course, there are no problems with either the viewing angles or the level of brightness.  By the way, there are no problems with highlights, because the surface of the monoblock monitor is matte.  Well, do not forget about the ability to connect two additional external monitors - and the number of connectors, and good hardware "stuffing" quite allow you to do this. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3183c1">Flexible configurations and professional graphics adapters</font> </h2><br>  There are a lot of options for choosing components from the Precision 5720 All-in-One monoblock, as, indeed, all of our professional workstations.  As a processor, you can choose Intel Xeon E3-1200 v5 or v6, as well as the Intel Core i5 or i7 of the 6th and 7th generations.  The maximum amount of RAM is 64 GB in four slots, with options available with or without error correction support (ECC). <br><br>  In addition, inside the machine there are three places to install data warehouses.  Two of them should be in the form factor of 2.5-inch HDD or SSD, and the third one is SSD of standard size M.2.  Considering these possibilities, we offer quite a few options for every taste and budget: from ordinary SSDs and HDDs on 256 GB and 500 GB to hybrid drives and high-speed SSDs with PCIe NVMe.  In more detail about available capacities it is possible to esteem <a href="http://www.dell.com/ru/business/p/precision-5720-aio/pd">here</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ho/-m/6s/ho-m6s2xly1edfaiorxfti5fely.jpeg"><br><br>  Options graphics accelerators exactly two.  In the basic version, this is the AMD Radeon Pro WX 4150 with 4 GB of memory, in the top version it is the Radeon PRO WX 7100 with 8 GB GDDR5.  The second GPU is not much more expensive, but significantly more interesting.  suggests an increased frequency, a bus width of 256 bits instead of 128 and 2304 stream processors instead of 896. Accordingly, if the priority is serious computation and, especially, work with shaders, then the unequivocal choice is WX 7100. <br><br>  Well, as the operating system, the user can choose Windows 10 Pro, Ubuntu or RedHat Enterprise Linux.  In addition, we offer a Dell Precision 5720 All-in-One with a touch screen.  In this case, the size of the computer is increased from 430x613x77.5 to 435x625x80.2 mm.  More and weight: the modification with touchxrin is 16.9 kg. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3183c1">You can change all the drives and expand the amount of RAM</font> </h2><br>  It may seem that a monoblock is a thing that is absolutely not upgradeable: what you bought, so you work.  Some manufacturers have this: even if something is inside and can be replaced, access to the components is carried out only after removing a very expensive module with a matrix.  The risk of damaging it in the process is very great. <br><br>  With the Dell Precision 5720 All-in-One, everything is much simpler.  Even an unprepared person can easily cope with the disassembly of a workstation.  To access the "stuffing", you need to put the device display down on a soft, non-scratching surface, lightly pull out a special plug on the back panel, lower the monoblock leg down, unscrew the two screws (you can not be afraid to lose them - they remain in their holes), and then just slide up the back cover of the computer.  And here is the picture that will eventually appear before your eyes: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pc/qw/mb/pcqwmb_mlja7lozaxz8kffo52pq.jpeg"><br><br>  On the left side you can see a tricky compartment for installing two 2.5-inch HDD or SSD.  In our configuration, it has only one slot: there is a Samsung PM871B solid-state drive with 512 GB of memory.  By the way, in the same photo you can see that the power supply Precision 5720 All-in-One is certified according to the standard 80 PLUS GOLD. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/e0/ov/ni/e0ovnioctdeek8c6-yjdo1b34mk.jpeg"><br><br>  Tray for installing 2.5-inch drives is removed in one motion: you just need to pull it up.  It is not necessary to unscrew the screws and then tighten them back - it is convenient. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yk/dg/jr/ykdgjr79klthri0webxqlrjnvtw.jpeg"><br><br>  To gain access to the RAM compartment, you need to remove a thin metal plate on the right side of the PC.  This is also done without special tools.  Here are 4 slots of compact SO-DIMM RAM.  In our case, they have 4 strips of RAM of 8 GB each.  And this is only half of the maximum - if desired, the amount of RAM can be increased to 64 GB. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3e/9d/28/3e9d287faw70b2zxhci88qivuhw.jpeg"><br><br>  Below is the slot M.2 for the installation of the third drive.  To gain access to it, you need to unscrew the three screws and remove the large metal protective plate. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xh/aq/vd/xhaqvds8xehkzhautz45_pmqvik.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#3183c1">Monoblock, which is ready for very serious tasks</font> </h2><br>  Now it's time to go to the story about the specific features of the filling Precision 5720 All-in-One.  Recall that we have one of the basic configurations of the workstation.  Inside Intel Xeon E3-1225 v6, AMD Radeon Pro WX4150 graphics, 32 GB DDR4 2133 MHz RAM with four slots ECC support.  Plus SSD-drive with 512 GB of memory. <br><br>  Let's start with the CPU: E3-1225 is one of two minor modifications in the new line of Intel Xeon v6 chips.  The basic clock frequency is 3.3 GHz; in Turbo mode, it can increase to 3.7 GHz.  A quad-core and four-flow chip, and the second by today's standards in solving many problems can become a bottleneck of the system.  That is why, as an option for the Precision 5720 All-in-One, we offer the Xeon E3-1275 v6 (4 cores, 8 streams, frequency 3.8 and 4.2 GHz) or the Intel Core i7-7700 (4 cores, 8 streams, frequency 3.6 and 4.2 GHz).  These are just two of the entire list of alternative chips, but it is the most logical thing to compare with them is the performance of the E3-1225 in the Cinebench R15 benchmark. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/b9/hr/6v/b9hr6v1t1rnwqkvw8gvgzi2sucg.png"><br><br>  The noise from the CPU cooler will not be disturbed by the user or others.  Even under a tangible load it is barely audible.  The chip at the same time can heat up above 70 degrees, but still far enough to critical values.  Of course there is no talk of throttling.  By the way, this is what the CPU cooling system looks like: thick copper pipes, a large radiator ... beauty! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yg/sq/f_/ygsqf_5rr6e2yyvnx_nreylvfx4.jpeg"><br><br>  In the PCMark 8 benchmark, we compared the performance of the Precision 5720 All-in-One with other Dell monoblocks in performing traditional undemanding office tasks, and that’s what happened. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k6/0u/yl/k60uylqxwnuvnqjcunap90g1u8g.png"><br><br>  In comparison to the performance in the 3DMark synthetic graphics test, it is appropriate to add a top-end Precision 5720 All-in-One with the Radeon Pro WX7100.  We didn’t have it at hand, but we asked for the data from colleagues, and we got this picture. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vu/iv/gs/vuivgsxt50ulhd3nkstgcfcgrxq.png"><br><br>  The base version of the Precision 5720 All-in-One confidently bypasses the office Optiplex 7450 and lags a bit behind one of the top configurations of the XPS 27 with more powerful consumer-class graphics.  However, the configuration with the WX7100 confidently bypasses all three alternatives.  Conclusion: The WX4150 is graphics for demanding, but relatively simple calculations and a good choice for a demanding home user who encounters professional tasks from time to time, and the WX7100 is a corporate solution or option for those cases where a monoblock needs maximum return.  In general, both graphics cards are well suited for working with large bitmaps, 3D graphics, video modeling and editing.  Including, in 4K. <br><br>  If in your free time you suddenly want to have some fun, then even the WX4150 won't let you down.  In our test configuration, we launched 4 games, and we managed to play comfortably in three of them even at a resolution of 2560x1440. <br><br>  World of Tanks is a classic of the genre: in it we have 39-45 fps in 2K and confident 60+ fps at maximum settings.  With Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus and GTA V, the situation is expectedly more complicated.  In 2K, the frame rate in them extremely rarely dropped below 30 frames per second and never reached the critical level of 24 fps.  In Full HD, GTA V produced 40 fps, and Wolfenstein 2 40-55 fps.  The graphics settings in both cases just in case were not twisted to the maximum, but simply remained high.  But in the demanding "The Witcher" it was not possible to play normally in 2K, although in Full HD the legendary RPG showed an average of more than 30 frames per second even at the very maximum graphics settings. <br><br>  In conclusion, a few words about the speed of the SSD-drive.  In the case of the Samsung PM871B drive with 512 GB of memory, which was in our test all-in-one, it was 550 MB / s for writing and 520 MB / s for reading.  Depending on the task, these values ​​in CrystalDiskMark 6.0.0 change as follows: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-7/bi/kg/-7bikgz27jdebf3mjsrhyxyb_jg.png"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#3183c1">Summary</font> </h2><br>  Prices for the <a href="http://www.dell.com/ru/business/p/precision-5720-aio/pd">Dell Precision 5720 All-in-One</a> in this configuration start at 171,000 rubles.  The cost of modifications with more productive graphics AMD Radeon Pro WX7100 starts with a mark of 203,000 rubles. <br><br>  In our opinion, the first option may well suit demanding home users and small companies, which in their daily work face the need to perform certain calculations, but their complexity is rather low.  We are talking about processing photos, editing video without “heavy” graphic effects and working with 3D models without an excessively large amount of detail.  But for serious work with graphics, we recommend top configurations with Xeon E3-1275 v6 and WX7100 - this bundle will perfectly show itself in all professional scenarios from editing 4K video to working with shaders. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uj/rt/5x/ujrt5xdqepnn9fcspmp6iz083ek.jpeg"><br><br>  Someone may argue that for the designated money you can easily build a desktop with greater performance.  However, you need to take into account that this will be, firstly, a less portable and convenient computer, which takes up much more space, requires more wires and consumes more power.  Secondly, the price should include a 4K-level monitor UltraSharp U2718Q, which is unlikely to cost less than 50,000 - 55,000 rubles, and the cost of external acoustics.  And finally, you will not have a convenient <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dell/blog/287980/">Dell Precision Optimiser</a> utility, <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dell/blog/295687/">ECC error-correcting memory</a> and <a href="http://www.dell.com/support/contents/ru/ru/rubsdc/article/product-support/self-support-knowledgebase/software-and-downloads/download-center/drivers-and-downloads/dell-certified-drivers-for-dell-precision-workstations">ISV certificates</a> that are important enough for corporate customers. <br><br>  In addition, do not forget about the rich set of configurations for the Precision 5720 All-in-One.  Virtually none of the competitors offers such a wide range of options and does not include Intel Xeon processors in the line, limited only to desktop Intel Core.  Plus Radeon Pro WX7100 - one of the most productive graphics card options presented in monoblocks today. </div>
