<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It is curious to observe how the attitude of people (and their own) to the <i>value of</i> long-familiar things, which previously did not attach special importance, changes.  For example, how we sleep.  Over the past fifteen years, advertising has successfully managed to convey a message about the importance of how we spend this third (if lucky) life - and many in the apartments have orthopedic mattresses that are sometimes more expensive than the beds themselves - I can imagine how absurd it would be for our parents twenty years ago. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sz/3g/gl/sz3gglccnon6v6xq4yy9nrtix7o.jpeg"><br><br>  The second third of life seems to be sitting.  As a student, one could be hunched over a computer in a rented room on a stool - or bring a chair from the kitchen.  Another source of freebies was writing off office furniture.  In the meantime, the word “orthopedic” seems increasingly attractive <s>with age</s> - and the market is experiencing some kind of boom: at least, the variation in prices and assortment is like from “Zhiguli” to “Cadillacs”.  But when the expensive American brand is out of the question - the Korean manufacturer comes to the rescue, and the orthopedic <a href="http://harachairs.ru/product/miracle-%25D1%258D%25D1%2580%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5-%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2588%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F-%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE/">Harachair Miracle</a> comes to replace the usual computer. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Two-faced * nous </h3><br>  The very first acquaintance with the range of chairs Harachair makes it clear that their chip - ingenuity.  And Miracle c forked seat for 16600в‚00 is still an economy class, the most expensive chair in their line is already <a href="http://harachairs.ru/product/doctor-%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE/">36.5 thousand</a> . <br><br>  The idea of ​​the seat of the two-part seat of Miracle is that it will sag under the weight of the rider more anatomically than the usual one, more evenly distributing the weight of the user. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7x/zz/vy/7xzzvyr5nmjzpco_9mj0zwsnkce.gif"><br><br>  Ideally, this should reduce the risk of stagnation of blood circulation in the pelvic organs, by participating in the prevention of the nightmare of everyone healed to the computer chair - hemorrhoids (or prostatitis). <br><br>  Of course, it’s not worth thinking about replacing real prevention with this — movement, but I didn’t notice any possible collateral damage to this design — and decided to take a chance. <br><br><h2>  Screwdriver assembly </h2><br>  The chair comes in a large box 45x70x80 cm unassembled. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6k/m1/ev/6km1ev71wemrmjlcmxo_28lxclk.jpeg"><br><br>  Fortunately, inside there is not a designer from Ikea, but only four large parts for assembly: a base of five legs on wheels, a seat, a back, and a pneumatic cartridge. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gl/yx/dy/glyxdyum4pgw9m_kwt_0azqfi3i.jpeg"><br><br>  The site specifically states that the wheels are double with protectors that are suitable for different types of floors.  Apparently, this is important - therefore, I confirm that the wheels are covered with a special layer of rubber, thanks to which it is quite pleasant to roll from place to place sitting in a chair - or to move the chair itself without the usual rumble of hard plastic. <br><br>  In principle, the chair was quite possible to bring and assembled - given the size of the box now.  Fortunately, the assembly is not even so close a headache, as is usually the case: the pneumatic cartridge just sticks into the base, and the seat is put on top.  ¾ done. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qd/uc/jj/qducjj1puqgq9g_fgdazzahbnji.jpeg"><br><br>  Attaching the backrest is a bit more complicated and requires the help of a hex-screwdriver that comes in the kit.  With its help, you need to tighten the two bolts that securely fix the backrest. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gm/y0/rx/gmy0rxrur2-pax-h9fcue-qqtso.jpeg"><br><br>  This is especially important, considering that the back of the “Hara” allows quite strongly - with an angle of at least 30 °, which is subjective, if you do not see yourself from the side - for example, in a mirror - perceived more extreme than it actually is - at such moments I want to be confident in the reliability of the whole structure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bt/ri/ts/btrits4j0qwqcmpt3fykr-2-dxg.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  Exterior </h2><br>  The only part that is missing in the kit is a sticky roller.  Fashionable fine-mesh synthetic fabric, which is covered with Miracle, attracts a lot of small debris.  At least, I had something to remove from it immediately after assembly, when the chair had not been in operation for even a minute. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3a/77/z4/3a77z4a15bquuz4k5ahiqoxo_ge.jpeg"><br><br>  Upholstery fabric is sewn on the seat and back, but on the armrests - in the form of removable covers.  However, under them it turns out to be not the most pleasant hard plastic, so I didn’t give up the covers - after all, due to the removability, they can be washed from time to time. <br><br>  The seat - in theory, the main eye catcher - in the life of the eye does not hurt and looks more like a functional piece of furniture than a design concept.  It is thanks to the unusual shape of the seat, I caught myself on how rarely do I look where I sit.  It is even logical - at least, explains the possibility of all the pranks associated with the seats of other people's chairs and armchairs: people really do not look where they sit. <br><br>  The “normality” of Miracle only contributed to absent-mindedness: when transferring from Miracle to my usual working chair, I understood in which one of them I was not sitting exactly on the seat - sitting in the chair, it was impossible to immediately understand whether the pillow was separated or whole. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_9/uj/9d/_9uj9dieg3zwg4taypiqu440xbm.jpeg"><br><br>  The most unnecessary part of the exterior is a pseudo-metal die in the center of the back.  Once, for a moment, it seemed to me that this was a through-cut in the back - it would have been better if it had been, for Miracle it would have gone. <br><br>  In reality, this is such a visual element of chic, reminiscent not so much of the life of the oligarchs, as of the design of Korean cars of the late 90s - the beginnings of zero ones.  I thought Korean car industry designers have since grown professionally since then - but some of them have obviously gone to design furniture. <br><br>  For better or for worse, but the most controversial detail of the design of the chair with a two-half seat is the “chrome” plaque in the center of the backrest. <br><br><h2>  Ergonomics </h2><br>  In the cover letter to the chair sent to the review it was mentioned that the seat of the two halves is more humane for the riders with prostatitis or hemorrhoids.  I do not know why they decided that I would be able to witness this somehow during the testing process - but to tell me, in fact, there is nothing to that effect. <br><br>  I was more worried about whether the user would have to pay convenience for such a marketing and design solution, highlighting the seat on the market?  Fortunately, no: I didn’t hope for any special advantages over ordinary seats - more importantly, I didn’t experience any particular inconvenience, quickly forgetting about the unusual design of the seat. <br><br>  I can understand those who buy Miracle according to the principle “it won't be worse”: for convenience, this is the same chair with a standard seat, and if it really doesn’t interfere with blood circulation less, then this is a very useful bonus. <br><br>  You can adjust the “Miracle” in height, angle of inclination of the back and seat depth. <br><br><ul><li>  The back will please fans to lean back and spit at the ceiling: it really folds away.  And when tilting, a small pillow starts to “work” in its lower part, which provides tangible support just in the place of the bend of the spine. </li><li>  The height adjustment of the chair at first seemed insufficient: with my 190 cm, it seemed that I didn’t have enough opportunity to raise the chair another half-latch higher on the maximum rise from the floor to the surface of the seat at half a meter exactly.  But in the mirror my reflection was sitting in the "Miracle" not with their knees up, as it would have been when the landing was too low, but with their legs bent, as recommended, at right angles.  The manufacturer indicates that the chair is designed for people as high as 200 cm. </li><li> Seat depth adjustment in the range of 43–46 cm is, in fact, in a tandem with height adjustment, because this is another important setting for the convenience of people of different height (to be precise, different leg lengths in this case).  And if you remove the lumbar support (this same pad at the bottom of the back), this will add another 4 cm to the adjustment, increasing the range to 47–50 cm. A half-meter-deep seat is an application for very long legs (or a strongly disproportionate figure). </li></ul><br>  Perhaps I was just used to the "excesses" - chairs that allow you to raise the seat a little higher than necessary, and then look for an ideal position on the descent.  For tall passengers, the maximum position is the best possible.  However, apart from anxiety at the first setting, in the future, the height of the “Hara” did not give me any inconvenience. <br><br>  The armrests on my trial "Miracle" were unregulated.  With the width of the seat half a meter flat (this is not me repeating myself, but Korean engineers) and with tightly fixed armrests and I sat on the “Hare” as on a bench.  That, in principle, is not necessarily such a disadvantage - and definitely dignity for clients is thicker: the permitted weight is up to 120 kg. <br><br>  It is logical: among those who can afford an average chair, like Miracle, and higher, like the rest of the Hara line, the price range may well be people on whom the sedentary lifestyle has left its mark. <br><br>  On the other hand, fat passengers more critical ergonomics chair.  For them, Miracle will work best.  The fact is that, as I noted, it is better when the lateral support is not so far from the sides: this allows you to get a more collected working posture. <br><br>  But, again, this difference was most felt when transferring from a chair to a chair.  A week later, I stopped paying attention to it. <br><br>  By the way, the height of the armrests is not properly too high: I could put my elbows on them, not raising my shoulders, keeping them relaxed - which is a sign of a proper fit. <br><br>  But if the soul (and the constitution) requires more subtle settings, then for some extra charge you can arrange adjustable armrests: from 19 to 27 cm from the level of the seat in height and 3 cm in the horizontal plane - that is, ± 6 cm along the span.  And this is a tangible - literally - change, because the armrests are now covered with a layer of soft vinyl instead of hard, rough plastic wrapped in a cover-oversold - a complete feeling that they have been torn off from some shabby business class chair. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-v/ae/qw/-vaeqwfri3pdo4zczeux_5qzhzm.jpeg"><br><br>  Can Hara Miracle be considered an ergonomic chair?  In full measure, of course, no - for this, there are not enough adjustments.  On the other hand, in the sense of not having tweaks, and the lack of fatty inconveniences - Miracle does not contain anything that would come out in two weeks of work for many hours to a number and rest in it. <br><br>  As a slogan on the site, I would not dare to call him “recuperating,” but I would use the principle “do no harm”: the main thing is that the years of work in Hara Miracle, like any other chair, do not diminish health. <br><br>  In general, if you do not expect a miracle from Miracle - this is a Korean chair, and not a Korean Jesus - then there will be no disappointment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d04/417/616/d044176167a669388a7f541a1b4d9092.gif" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a04/44d/b13/a0444db132d310dfba7e37a4f9276068.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And they are looking for health without sitting - that is why the “sedentary lifestyle” is usually not praise.  For health ass from the seat, whole or molded, it is necessary to tear. </div>
