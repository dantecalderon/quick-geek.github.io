  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How does the Ivideon video surveillance system: a review of the mobile application</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Last time we talked about the <a href="https://habr.com/company/ivideon/blog/434308/">desktop application</a> for our video surveillance service.  The theme of today's material is mobile apps.  We show the possibilities, let's talk about the UI and the functions of the system, adapted for working with mobile devices. <br><br>  The application in a smartphone or tablet is best, according to users, helps to monitor various objects of observation and to combine many geographically distributed cameras into a single system. <br><br>  In Ivideon mobile applications, the number of installations exceeds one million, and the rating has remained consistently high for years.  However, it all started not so well: you can not succeed with just the speed of work or changes in UX / UI.  We have introduced an additional performance criterion - we will also tell about it. <br><br> <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/ivideon/blog/436194/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hg/2r/df/hg2rdfbgad0k-_xsakluvwiitem.jpeg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  What tasks do mobile apps solve? </h2><br>  Ivideon mobile apps for Android and iOS have almost the same capabilities as the Ivideon Desktop Client, but getting all the features of the service is much more convenient on a smartphone - it is always at hand.  In fact, the main task of mobile clients is to simplify for the user: <br><br><ol><li>  viewing video archive; </li><li>  access to live camera feeds; </li><li>  receiving notifications about events (something happens in the frame). </li></ol><br>  Mobile applications open access to a cloud or local archive and are capable of receiving push notifications in real time when motion or sound sensors are triggered.  Thus, the user gets the opportunity to quickly find out what is happening right now in his store, office or apartment. <br><br><h2>  How does the application on Android </h2><br>  Further, using the example of <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.ivideon.client%26hl%3Dru">an Android application</a> , we will describe the interface: we will show what the client sees and what functions he can use.  We also have the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D1%258E%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5-ivideon/id464234175">Ivideon app for iOS</a> - it has similar functionality (and a very similar interface), so we will not consider it as part of this material. <br><br><h5>  Connecting cameras and broadcasts </h5><br>  After starting Ivideon, the user will have access to the new camera connection menu. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/y7/sd/p4/y7sdp41rzq3xxybe9pfighk-eou.jpeg" width="240"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wv/l7/b3/wvl7b3_hx5949_mn3ckia-hapwu.jpeg" width="240"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9b/2b/9b/9b2b9b4i14nmirt6dm3gq3yadwm.jpeg" width="240"><br><br>  The connection is simple: the user selects from the list of manufacturers of video equipment available model of the device.  Further, it remains to specify the binding option - QR-code, MAC-address, Ivideon Server. <br><br>  The fastest way is connecting cameras with Ivideon firmware - all you need to do is show the camera a QR code from the application.  If the camera does not have a built-in Ivideon service, the application will offer to download and install the Ivideon Server program, which we described in the last article. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u7/bk/wh/u7bkwhzpdymirpxurnrntumjcaw.jpeg" width="240"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/af/sx/g0/afsxg0z2xaamf5f4gsiczlggi9s.jpeg" width="240"><br><br>  After adding cameras, they will be displayed on the Cameras tab.  Multiple cameras are conveniently monitored on the Layouts and Groups tabs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mn/pk/vg/mnpkvg1tcavecdy2bc0sgonafqk.jpeg" width="240"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ei/78/0s/ei780sn-d0uj3e77vrjjhokddsy.jpeg" width="240"><br><br>  If you click on one of the cameras, the video player opens with a live broadcast (Live).  Here is the time scale on which all the events recorded by the program detector are marked - in fact, we are talking about all the recordings available from the camera. <br><br><h5>  Events and archive </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zc/vc/7l/zcvc7l7wupuepwkxtwpnt33yz_y.jpeg" width="480"><br><br>  If necessary, all videos are easy to find in a separate tab of the application - called Events.  An event in Ivideon is a short video recorded by the system when a motion / sound detector is triggered.  Events allow you to quickly find out what is happening at the monitored object. <br><br>  In the Event View mode, short videos can be saved to the phone or forwarded to another user.  The depth of available records depends on the tariff plan.  At the free rate of 24 hours only 10-second event videos are stored. <br><br>  At paid rates, the camera records the entire event - from the moment the traffic starts to its completion.  Accordingly, through the player in the application, you can unwind all the records a day ago ... or even a month (and more!), If you have the appropriate tariff for business connected. <br><br>  Some clients choose to write to the cloud for specific tasks ‚Äî i.e.  even if there is no movement in the frame.  All this data remains available through the mobile application - just select the record of interest on the time scale or through the calendar (by clicking the corresponding icon). <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pL_e_iaWTyM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><blockquote>  The Android application has animation in the event feed (live preview).  Animations provide an opportunity to understand the cause of the sensor triggering, without opening the video itself. </blockquote><br><h5>  Layouts and groups </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2u/yb/fr/2uybfrdaekkslbng4kg8yxvculq.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  As we have said, the main function of the mobile application is to view video streams from cameras.  As in the case of the desktop application, the user <a href="https://ru.ivideon.com/blog/mobilnyie-raskladki-v-ivideon-client-2.10.0-dlya-android-uvidet-bolshe-za-to-zhe-vremya/">can work with the layouts of all connected cameras</a> by adjusting the grid.  This makes it possible to display dozens of broadcasts at once.  We optimized the broadcasting display so as to save the traffic and the battery charge of the smartphone. <br><br>  Up to thirty-six cameras can be added to each layout.  The number of layouts is not limited.  Also, the application has the ability to work with layouts generated in the desktop or Ivideon Client web application for Windows, Linux or MacOS operating systems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zb/v9/qv/zbv9qvgmqgc-9cybmswfebxkws0.jpeg" width="480"><br><br>  Last year, we added camera grouping to the application.  Devices can be combined, for example, according to the structure of the company (by geographical location, departments, etc.).  Note that this feature is available only to accounts with a ‚ÄúFor Business‚Äù subscription, because, first of all, it is necessary for customers with hundreds of video surveillance devices. <br><br><h5>  Settings </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ll/vo/c3/llvoc3vcjhbbt0ejj8kwipgqf6a.jpeg" width="240"><br><br>  Account settings allow you to change the settings of all connected cameras at once: turn notifications on and off, choose video quality, set sounds for various types of events.  In the latter case, the application sends a notification if the camera registers a suspicious movement or sound, turns the device on and off, and so on. <br><br><blockquote>  The unique sound of the alert immediately makes it clear that it came from Ivideon, and this is not a regular SMS or WhatsApp message. </blockquote><br>  You can include not only a special sound notification, but also receiving short clips of events - this is convenient if you have several cameras and you need to carefully monitor any incidents.  In addition, settings are available for each camera separately. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/op/tg/vp/optgvpj6oewyazhu8ldhpglea8q.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the settings, the access rights to individual connected cameras are changed (you can transfer control over a group of cameras in your personal account).  For example, it is convenient to give managers the opportunity to watch only broadcasts, to the security service to control the pivoting functions of cameras, to the director to access the archive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kl/fs/ii/klfsii2gkignqlp1trwmezx0t-a.jpeg" width="240"><br><br>  Each camera has its own zone and detection sensitivity.  This setting allows you to clearly focus the camera on the task (for example, the detection of people) and not be distracted by false signals (movement in the frame of tree branches). <br><br><h5>  Support </h5><br>  In the application for users organized section "Help" with the FAQ.  There are collected answers to questions about the supported equipment, methods of connection, as well as a cloud service for storing video recordings (which we talked about <a href="https://habr.com/company/ivideon/blog/434308/">in the previous article</a> ). <br><br>  If the user fails to solve the problem on his own, he can always ask a question to the technical support service that works around the clock.  We respond to appeals on average within an hour.  We will answer the simple question in the application or via mail, but if you need phone consultation to solve the problem, then you will definitely contact the client. <br><br>  You can make an arbitrarily good application, but without a competent TP, it makes no sense.  Therefore, we have introduced an important quality criterion in our work - loyalty.  In Ivideon, we respond to every request for help, and <b>do not divide users into paid and free</b> . <br><br>  Sometimes the desire to help everyone leads to paradoxical situations - customers even baffle us with requests like: ‚ÄúHelp!  Your camera took off, as in my apartment, the objects themselves move! ‚Äù- but this strategy turns out to be mutually beneficial in the long term.  We think that largely due to the quick response to user requests, we are kept in the top of applications for video surveillance. <br><br><hr><br>  <i>We regularly improve applications, introducing new features.</i>  <i>Last year, we added animation in the Android event feed, created a new interface for voice communication through the camera speaker (push-to-talk function), and implemented WebRTC (optimized player) for smooth real-time broadcasting.</i>  <i>The introduction of web real-time communications has reduced the delay of live video from cameras by 5-7 times.</i>  <i>The effect of the transition was noticeable immediately.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The main features can be estimated without registration - a demo mode is available.</i>  <i>You can download Ivideon applications in <b><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.ivideon.client%26hl%3Dru">Google.Play</a></b> and the <b><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D1%258E%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5-ivideon/id464234175">App Store</a></b> - it's free, like all subsequent updates.</i>  <i>If, as a result of the test, you notice that you can do better or, perhaps, catch a bug, write about it in the comments.</i>  <i>Focus on the future - help users solve their problems faster.</i>  <i>And for this, we again rely on feedback.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/436194/">https://habr.com/ru/post/436194/</a></p>
