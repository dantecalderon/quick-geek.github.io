<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The Russian government did not support paid registration of devices in mobile networks via IMEI, as <a href="https://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/news/2019/01/25/792453-platnuyu-registratsiyu">reported</a> by Vedomosti.  Nevertheless, the officials consider the registration idea itself to be correct, as stated by the vice-premier Maxim Akimov, the curator of the Digital Economy program. <br><br>  “We are now discussing this with the Minister of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Communications Konstantin Noskov, we do not support the idea of ​​payment, we support the idea of ​​registration,” said Akimov.  In his opinion, the registration procedure will increase the effectiveness of anti-theft devices and to ensure national security. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  "When making transparent decisions about turning off such devices, such as those stolen from citizens, the giant criminal market will collapse, because it will not make sense to steal only if you donate them for parts," he said.  The government in question, the bill in question, has not yet been submitted. <br><br>  As for the idea itself, it <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/437458/">has already been written</a> about it.  The State Duma introduced a bill on the mandatory introduction of February 1, 2020 paid registration of all devices that operate in cellular networks.  It can be mobile phones, tablets, Internet of Things devices (even smart meters of heat, water and gas). <br><br>  By IMEI number, new manufacturers and importers will be obliged to register new mobile devices.  In addition, physical persons will also be required to register gadgets in the event that purchased them abroad.  The cost of paid registration, according to officials, will not exceed 100 rubles. <br><br><blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jy/sd/rr/jysdrr7tqgfjt50wtcshw89ctho.png" align="left"><h3>  Minute of care from UFO </h3><br>  This material could cause contradictory feelings, so before writing a comment, refresh something important in your memory: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How to write a comment and survive</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  Do not write abusive comments, do not go to the person. </li><li>  Refrain from using obscene language and toxic behavior (even in a veiled form). </li><li>  To report comments that violate the rules of the site, use the "Report" button (if available) or <a href="https://habr.com/feedback/%3Ftype%3D4">a feedback form</a> . </li></ul><br>  What to do if: <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/karma/">minus karma</a> |  <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/sandbox/">blocked account</a> <br><br>  → <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/other/">Code of authors Habra</a> and <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/other/">habraetiket</a> <br>  → <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/rules/">Full site rules</a> </div></div></blockquote></div>
