Any amount can be sold to a legal entity — from one piece, ”said a representative of the Avtomatika concern in the TASS <a href="https://tass.ru/ekonomika/6073462">commentary</a> . <br><br>  The specialist explained that the device is equipped with a real-time operating system of its own design - very tough and severely curtailed for information security purposes: "Thanks to the applied technical solutions and the know-how of our developers, the device cannot be hacked and listened to," the representative of Avtomatika added. <br><br><h1>  The protected laptop for 500 000 rub. </h1><br>  This is not the only secure gadget from Rostec enterprises.  For example, in July last year, the Ruselectronics holding presented at the international industrial exhibition Innoprom-2018 a serial sample of a new version of a domestic protected laptop for extreme operating conditions.  The 17-inch laptop works on the Russian Elbrus 1C + microprocessor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/652/908/ef0/652908ef0c3f5e1a618dd9995b5f5170.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="https://rostec.ru/news/rostekh-predstavil-sverkhprochnyy-noutbuk-dlya-ekstremalnykh-usloviy/">The EC1866 laptop</a> can be used by security agencies for solving various control tasks and working with secret information in the field.  The developers believe that the EU1866 can be used for civilian purposes, namely “in industry, logistics, agriculture, to provide medical care outside of medical institutions and / or in emergency situations”.  In July, the holding announced that it was fully ready for mass production of this product, but did not name the price.  Soon, third-party sources reported that the Ministry of Defense will purchase these laptops <a href="https://www.ixbt.com/news/2018/07/09/1866-500-000.html">at 500,000 rubles.</a>  <a href="https://www.ixbt.com/news/2018/07/09/1866-500-000.html">for a piece</a> . <br><br>  “Import substitution in IT is one of the key tasks of Rostec.  Developments in this direction are systematically carried out by many enterprises of the State Corporation.  This is especially important in the face of a growing number of cyber threats.  The product we have created is based on the Elbrus domestic secure platform and works under the control of Russian software.  This approach protects users as much as possible against possible information leaks, ” <a href="https://rostec.ru/news/rostekh-predstavil-sverkhprochnyy-noutbuk-dlya-ekstremalnykh-usloviy/">explained</a> Ekaterina Baranova, Rostec State Corporation’s Communications Director. <br><br><h1>  Protected Messenger </h1><br>  Recently it became known about another initiative of "Rostec" in the field of import substitution.
