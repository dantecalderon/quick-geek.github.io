<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Many believe that in 9-10 years, you can program a maximum on Scratch.  But it is not.  In 9 years, you can also cut programs on C # Windows Forms.  The main desire. <br><br><h2>  How it all began </h2><br>  It all started when I wanted to make a full-fledged computer in Minecraft. <br><br>  <s>I arranged a DDoS attack on Yandex.</s> I was looking for information on how the computer works.  During the search, I came across a video course on Sharp.  And so it began ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Not so simple in this life </h2><br>  I looked at the first lesson “What is C # and why is it needed?”. <br><br>  I thought: <br><br>  “Why train to the end?  Install Visual Studio, click on the buttons (not on the keyboard) and you're done!  I am a programmer!" <br><br>  But not everything is so simple. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d56/e5c/878/d56e5c8780562697354794df369cf874.png" alt="image" width="400"><br><br>  <font color="gray"><i>What is it?</i></font>  <font color="gray"><i>Ahhh!</i></font>  <font color="gray"><i>Help!</i></font> <br><br>  Began to hit the keyboard ... not in Visual Studio, but in Yandex: <br>  <i>"How to program"</i> <i><br></i>  <i>"How to program in C #"</i> <i><br></i>  <i>"C # Lessons"</i> <i><br></i>  Etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/173/76b/8eb/17376b8ebf88000182a74b75f4d8af51.jpg" width="400"><br><br>  <font color="gray"><i>Gone up!</i></font> <br><br>  Found sites metanit.com and professorweb.ru.  Was reading… <br><br><h2>  First results </h2><br>  At first I worked in the console.  I made a console “notepad”, a console calculator, even wrote a “virtual machine” and “programming language” (did not finish it). <br>  (Unfortunately, they are not preserved). <br><br><h2>  Window applications </h2><br>  I downloaded <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/%3FLinkId%3D160472%26clcid%3D0x419">this</a> book.  Called "C # for schoolchildren."  It has lessons on creating Windows Forms applications.  Touched, did. <br><br><h2>  Games </h2><br>  Tired of writing boring, <i>useless</i> applications. <br>  And I got an idea!  Make a mini-game on Windows Forms! <br>  Called Adventure of Warrior. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/312768697" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Started learning XNA.

How did I win?  I was not allowed to compete with programmers from high school.  And I was a third-grader.  They started to compete with second-graders.  While they were talking about trains, how they work, traffic rules, etc., I came. <br>  Showed the game, and everything - 1 place! <br><br>  The second time did not get into the prizes.  Although my program is so-so.  Called Alprog.RadioWave– application for listening to Internet radio. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/250/e06/0a5/250e060a51898747536d07bb373ad463.png" alt="Alprog.RadioWave" width="400"><br><br><h2>  Switch to WPF </h2><br>  <font color="gray"><i>Two years later</i></font> <br><br>  Hooray!  I can write on Windows Forms! <br><br>  In the meantime, I wanted to do something new!  Animation, translucency elements. <br>  Why GDI can not work with a video card?  He does not pull! <br><br>  Looking for ... Oooh!  Found!  WPF! <br><br>  MVVM?  What is it?? <br><br>  Already angry, I thought to write my UI Framework in Windows Forms on OpenGL. <br>  Started to do.  Oh!  Another OpenGL need to learn!  And how to draw a button?  Textures in Photoshop do? <br><br>  I stepped over the threshold of " <u>fucking</u> learn!  I’m still <u>sleeping</u> ! ”And began to teach.  Practice is a golden thing in learning. <br><br><h2>  What now? </h2><br>  And now in 2019, when I am 11 years old, I study at Xamarin.Forms and develop an organizer.  Called Alprog.Priority. <br><br>  The first version was called <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/alprog-xnote/">Alprog.XNote</a> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/af3/31b/10f/af331b10f615f8d72915e7db4ef4c670.jpg" alt="Alprog.XNote" width="500"><br><br>  <font color="gray"><i>Already on WPF</i></font> <br><br>  Here is the main one: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/312777483" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  He became a school "tyzhprogrammist".  Informatics passed externally.  If anything, teachers contact me (very often). <br><br>  At the lessons of computer science I bring my laptop and create it.  Computer science teacher became my mentor. <br><br>  Very grateful to him.  Sometimes it happens that there are no ideas - I want to quit programming.  And the teacher tells me where to go next.  And I'm starting to implement new ideas. <br>  I am also grateful to my parents for their support and faith in me. <br><br><h2>  Results </h2><br>  As you can see, if there is a desire, then there is a result.  Slightly dance with a tambourine around the computer, and put a semicolon on time. <br><br>  PS Wait for new articles! </div>
