<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tn/kg/dt/tnkgdtym-yvl69tgvaviec1ps7s.jpeg"><br><br>  We use smartphones for almost everything, why not use mobile technology to improve our own health?  A smartphone can help lead a healthier lifestyle, remotely monitor important indicators (for example, monitor the level of glucose in the blood), save money on medical services. <br><br>  In 2018, the law on telemedicine came into force, which means that Russian doctors using telephones and mobile applications will be able to hold consultations, consultations, and remotely monitor the patient's health.  Telemedicine, wearable smart devices and applications will help reduce costs and improve the quality of medical services.  How exactly this will happen - we will tell further. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Applications help to run or contribute to the early detection of symptoms of various diseases.  Almost any modern smartphone helps to measure blood pressure, heart rate, temperature and physical activity of the user. <br><br>  The method of photoplethysmography <a href="https://3dnews.ru/912292">allows</a> you to measure blood pressure using any good camera.  Based on the method, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcomm.cchong.BloodAssistant%26hl%3Dru">applications</a> are created with a very simple principle of operation: you are photographing a fingertip with a flash.  Diagnostics is based on measuring the brightness of light reflected from the skin, and as a result - changes in the skin structure and blood flow. <br><br>  Can programs completely replace medical equipment - for example, a tonometer?  No, but “health sensors” and related apps motivate users to lead a more active lifestyle.  Of course, the smartphone is inferior in accuracy to specialized devices.  You can not rely only on the readings of the sensors.  However, thanks to new applications and wearable smart watches / bracelets, everyone can now control diet, exercise, improve the quality of life without complex or expensive equipment. <br><br>  It’s impossible to tell about all the good apps - in the health / fitness / sport category you can find tens of thousands of programs.  But we chose the most popular (by the number of downloads and user ratings) in several categories, covering various aspects of health and longevity. <br><br><h2>  Symptom check </h2><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/z6/aa/t1/z6aat14lt7kkz0tbzw2bb7vbmpq.jpeg" height="500"></div><br><br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.babylon%26hl%3Dru">Babylon</a> application checks the symptoms of various diseases.

A huge amount of data on the patient's health can be obtained from just one drop of blood, analyzed using a single external sensor.  The Internet of Things will change our experience of interacting with smartphones in the near future and bring it to a new level, providing amazing opportunities for the body and brain. </div>
