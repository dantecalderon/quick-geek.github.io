<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A couple of days ago in the compilation for March 8, the mention of SleepDot tracker appeared in a blog of one of the companies, and it might be misleading for some attentive users, because it was compiled with factual errors.  SleepDot, which was discussed, is a re-release of the Sleepace tracker, the company that creates gadgets and accessories for sleeping. <br><br>  The readers of our publications are already familiar with this brand: back in 2015, we <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/248144/">talked</a> about the first version of the RestOn tracker, and more recently, we talked <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/298577/">about what the</a> second is curious about. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6u/uu/ny/6uuuny5zw1irvosfi-hkbqyru8q.jpeg"><br><br>  The range, however, is much broader.  Those who are interested in this topic, we invite to our small selection. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  By and large, all devices can be divided into two large categories: “help in falling asleep” gadgets (including smart lamps and headphones) and gadgets for sleep analytics (both versions of RestOn, both versions of SleepDot).  Some devices can work both with the connection to the Sleepace application, and without it, the use of others without reference to the software does not make any sense. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bm/zt/_d/bmzt_djtrhqiv5zwo7k6gan1hxq.jpeg"><br><br>  Currently, we have brought several devices from this list to Russia: one of the lamps, the second version of SleepDot, headphones and RestOn.  We offer you a brief information about them. <br><br>  <b>Sleepepot</b> <br><br>  Currently the second version of this device is available in the catalog.  The first one was simpler and was known mostly as <a href="https://ru.aliexpress.com/item/Original-xiaomi-mijia-sleepace-sleep-sensor-Ble-Wifi-Remote-Control-APP-for-Andriod-IOS-Zero-Radiation/32830759241.html%3Fws_ab_test%3Dsearchweb0_0,searchweb201602_5_10152_10151_10065_10344_10068_10342_10343_10340_10341_10543_10084_10083_10618_10307_10301_10313_10059_5711217_10534_100031_10103_5722417_10627_10626_10624_10623_10622_10621_10620_5711317_10125,searchweb201603_25,ppcSwitch_4%26algo_expid%3D74fd78a9-3969-4887-80b7-9752bee48e8b-0%26algo_pvid%3D74fd78a9-3969-4887-80b7-9752bee48e8b%26priceBeautifyAB%3D0">Xiaomi Sleepace</a> , in any case, it was sold on Chinese websites. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nl/n_/b4/nln_b4b9qyb1bhgbhgfcagohdpa.jpeg"><br><br>  Surprisingly, this is not enough: firstly, though, the company Sleepace willingly cooperates with different companies, allowing them to glue their logos on finished products, and, secondly, it is also known how Xiaomi releases new gadgets, so this name is hardly a coincidence.  The second version of SleepDot differs from the Xiaomi tracker by the presence of temperature and humidity sensors: they are indicated by holes in the case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mm/t_/g2/mmt_g2-5vtzvd6auunzeghhxkrs.jpeg"><br><br>  The form close to the square refers us again to the first version of the RestOn tracker.  Actually, it seems, “Slipdot” was created as a kind of miniature analogue of more advanced trackers.  If you compare even with the Z400 model, then there are common features in the design: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/du/uq/ps/duuqpstles01vo6zwy3c5izi5z0.jpeg"><br><br>  A common way of attaching to a bed is with a magnetic cover. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qd/ic/oc/qdicoc8i-jqhqilrrxend3hqrfw.jpeg"><br><br>  And, of course, similar sensors and similar metrics for analysis in the application.  However, the SleepDot tracker is somewhat simpler: there is no heart rate monitor, it is not possible to analyze the breath, and there are no speakers playing music, as stated just in a recent compilation. <br><br>  <b>SleepDot can:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Sleep Cycle Tracking </li><li>  Temperature and humidity analysis </li><li>  Turn Analysis </li></ul><br>  To work with the device, you need to connect it to the company's Sleepace application.  Here will also be available auxiliary tools for better sleep, setting up a smart alarm clock for the smartphone and statistics with reports. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9t/kz/5j/9tkz5jwcpyvrkxdtt53vm0jrfya.jpeg"><br><br>  Without plunging into statistics, you can see the phases of sleep, the number of movements in a dream, as well as the temperature and humidity in the room.  The graphs evenly go one below the other, which will allow, for example, to correlate how you turned around with the surrounding factors, so that in the future you can improve the quality of sleep by changing certain factors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wc/2l/u3/wc2lu3go_3__rcr4qaxidzi9lb8.jpeg"><br><br>  Tips and recommendations are also attached to this: your sleep is represented by points by default, where points are consistently taken from 100 points, taking into account the particularities of sleep.  As a result, you get a comment on each item and tips on how to improve sleep with improvised means: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gg/5m/7k/gg5m7kclvhwmbvegtmw-ljz_6zu.jpeg"><br><br>  Depending on the measures taken in the future, you will be able to observe over time: a week or a month, how your indicators change for the better, which ultimately should lead you to a better rest! <br><br>  <b>How to install SleepDot</b> <br><br>  Unlike the RestOn tracker, SleepDot is attached to the edge of the pillowcase. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rw/f1/pp/rwf1pptgx4gdxqfv_6ugwlwxrz8.jpeg"><br><br>  In principle, the magnet is rather tenacious, but it is better to remove one of the parts as if inside. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7p/-a/nv/7p-anvzcpodiqrt0myxnst4yqfc.gif"><br><br>  After installation, you need to tap the device slightly twice to wake up the green signal and synchronize it with the device: you can immediately set up automatic sleep tracking by time, if you plan to fall asleep every day at about the same hour. <br><br>  It should be noted that the features of the SleepDot attachment affect the result.  If we compare it with the RestOn tracker, the movement metric will be different.  Here, for example, the same night with two different trackers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zs/1w/lc/zs1wlcl-chuf-td74hkhbp6d83g.jpeg"><br><br>  Metrics and are called differently: "Movement" and "Position change".  The RestOn tracker, the one with the tape, takes into account how you turned and changed your posture, SleepDot also records movements, and, probably, a person makes more head movements during sleep, plus you can add involuntary movements with your hands, etc. also need to be considered. <br><br>  In general, the SleepDot in the second version is quite curious and everything is also miniaturized.  Now the gadget analyzes the environment, including climate tips, which is also valuable and also certainly affects the quality of sleep.  And, of course, such a tracker can be used while in bed with someone else. <br><br>  It comes in a compact box. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pv/tt/wu/pvttwuctrodcbsxr36hldaegy_g.jpeg"><br><br>  Where you will find instructions in Russian, a mediator in order to open the case and the battery - you do not need to charge the device, it works from CR. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qu/k4/nv/quk4nvwctzowq4dyheumdl0moc0.jpeg"><br><br>  Despite the fact that it is inferior in terms of information content to the “elder brother,” it was created for people who are unaware of their health problems and do not need additional means of control: <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/sleepace-sleep-dot-b502t.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dsleepace%26utm_campaign%3Dsleepdot">SleepDot</a> should be taken solely as an assistant to improve sleep. <br><br>  <b>Reston</b> <br><br>  We have already devoted a <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/298577/">large review of the</a> unique RestOn gadget, however, let us recall in a few words what kind of device it is. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pc/g7/8g/pcg78gtr52nl10mgkrxda6kgf5k.jpeg"><br><br>  It is also a device for analyzing sleep, and today, if you don’t recall everything that has gone from the market, like Beddit, Withings, for example, you can recognize it as unique.  This tracker gives the most complete picture of what happens to a person in a dream, including heart rate and respiratory rate, which undoubtedly makes him valuable for use. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8r/ez/ae/8rezae3hqx_izfpqcgioxlsthxy.jpeg"><br><br>  The principle of accountability is similar here: this is 100 points minus points due to atypical, “wrong” actions, however, there are already points for health indicators: too high a pulse or too frequent / too slow breathing, etc. <br><br>  <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/sleepace-reston-z400t.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dsleepace%26utm_campaign%3DrestOn">RestOn is</a> truly good because it allows you to conveniently analyze the main indicators of human life at home when it is most vulnerable - in a dream, which in the future can help prevent a number of problems and indicate the need for consultation with a specialist. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2v7oLTY5QHc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  We recommend looking at it. <br><br>  <b>Nox speaker lamp</b> <br><br>  Sleepace Smart Lamps are “tools that help you fall asleep.”  <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/nox-music.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dsleepace%26utm_campaign%3Dnox">Nox Music</a> - one of the range. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0n/2f/yw/0n2fyw5xbq70ruux1infwhinau8.jpeg"><br><br>  This elongated device at the base resembles a square, which consists of two parts: the top is light, the bottom is sound.  The gadget supports control from a smartphone, as well as gesture and touch controls. <br><br>  For example, when playing music, the side walls of the bottom speaker become the volume buttons: by slightly tapping on the left, you can reduce the sound by tapping on the right, respectively, to increase. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/on/vc/mr/onvcmreeqe5tamzypb9ne-pltjw.jpeg"><br><br>  Silicone gasket provides stability on the surface of the device, so even if it is careless, already falling asleep, reach for Nox to turn it off, move it, to drop it, it is still not so easy to drop it. <br><br>  Nox is powered from the network - the connector for connection is located on the back side. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pk/ko/2v/pkko2vz2hd8mo1i8a52q9uj0jqw.jpeg"><br><br>  Here is the USB output, probably in case you occupied the last socket under the lamp, and you need to charge the smartphone somehow.  Comes with several adapters for the adapter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/c3/9c/6s/c39c6s3_et9qhhjukcmgy84yqzo.jpeg"><br><br>  The top of the lamp also has a silicone case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/j_/ex/9z/j_ex9zareq3pizg0zsrx9e7wssy.jpeg"><br><br>  The entire kit is accompanied by Russian-language instructions, as well as any questions and answers, management recommendations transferred to the application Sleepace. <br><br>  You can control the lamp with gestures.  This is quite convenient when, before going to bed, you can, for example, turn down the light by touching the lamp, or change it by waving a hand in front of the control button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/id/lm/p0/idlmp0da68reexl83qhq-inbsmy.gif"><br><br>  The control button is a touch sensor and a motion sensor; you cannot press it.  With it, the lamp turns on and off, holding the button also activates the mode “Help in falling asleep” and turns on the soothing music of the waves. <br><br>  Light and sound "out of sync."  That is, you can turn off the light, but continue to listen to music before bedtime, the speakers work all the time while the lamp is connected to the network.  The lamp is connected not only in the application, but also as an external speaker in the Bluetooth settings, so you can listen to anything you like. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5z/t-/lr/5zt-lrbw4yjuv2wukx3-oiouhgq.jpeg"><br><br>  For those who do not want to bother remembering commands and sweeps, although this, believe me, is not very difficult: we did it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/c8/p_/5q/c8p_5qebd16vnj7xfu2lojds0jy.gif"><br><br>  So, for those who do not want to bother, there is an opportunity to control the lamp through the application.  There will also be available to change colors and modes, adjust the brightness, the ability to run an automatic periodic color change. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/po/88/b-/po88b-yq0dgg_ot9c2sx94ukg3i.jpeg"><br><br>  Turn on and off the light is also possible through the application.  In general, the impressions of the use remained positive: an uncomplicated gadget with clear features, many of which were already known and in demand in the market before.  Here, convenient control and quite good sound for a small speaker. <br><br>  <b>Sleepace Headphones</b> <br><br>  Perhaps the easiest gadget to date in the company's range. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/r1/5s/ro/r15sroy5giralj8sgeydiitce1g.jpeg"><br><br>  Goals and objectives as simple and clear as possible: help to comfortably fall asleep to the music.  You can use them again together with the Sleepace application, where there is a special meditative selection, or fall asleep under your favorite tracks. <br><br>  From a security point of view, it can be noted here that external loud sounds will still be accessible to the ear - the headphones do not have noise cancellation.  For hearing, their use is also comfortable within reasonable limits - it is still not a gag.  They will not be able to hurt you either - soft headphones from the case to the speakers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kl/jq/x4/kljqx4nfvu2d-3cl-3_aed85fs4.jpeg"><br><br>  We have already spoken about the value of music for a more comfortable process of falling asleep: there are indeed a number of studies discussing sounds up to specific frequencies that affect the improvement of sleep, but in everyday life one can see that just the sound in the background is already lulling. <br><br>  To fall asleep in ordinary headphones is not so comfortable and safe, including for the headphones themselves.  Models made of plastic can break and generally cause discomfort due to the design features. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_o/n0/5u/_on05ulqwpwc75cjg-8sh7q5pme.jpeg"><br><br>  Therefore, soft headphones and come into vogue, and become a normal accessory that does not cause any confusion.  <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/sleepace-smart-headphone.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dsleepace%26utm_campaign%3Dheadphones">Headphones from Sleepace</a> - also a mask that will eliminate the impact of external signals, light, and it is better to fall asleep.  This way to “get away from reality” will be appreciated by those who spend a lot of time on trips and business trips. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hz/ht/xk/hzhtxkb6ilmbt_etzj474ppil9c.jpeg"><br><br>  To make the skin feel more comfortable under the mask, a special lining is provided.  However, sooner or later, the mask will still have to be washed out of hygienic considerations: there will also be no problems here, the speakers are easy to pull out. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sh/fn/g8/shfng8ksvrvfipvcvvtzp44l70g.jpeg"><br><br>  A key feature of these speakers is that they are soft, hidden in a special fabric soft pad, which makes them invisible to the user, even during sleep.  The device can also be paired with a smartphone, but sleep monitoring will be performed by the smartphone, not the headphones, for which your smartphone should not lie on the bedside table, but on the bed next to you. </div>
