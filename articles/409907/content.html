<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Immediately, two of my readers sent LED lamps from the Russian brand Ecola to the test.  The test results can not but surprise and I knowingly remembered the "Russian roulette". <br><br>  Here are two lamp-tablets GX53 with the same article and barcode, purchased at the same online store at the same time.  Do you think they are the same?  If! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dab/808/b4e/dab808b4e99281a3c1f63a3a77f1d59f.jpg"></div><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The lamps themselves are identical in design, only the font of the inscriptions and the release date are different - May and July 2017. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2d0/986/755/2d09867559fdc4be607870b705512ebb.jpg"></div><br><br>  The box for a lamp released in July is slightly smaller.  All the inscriptions on the box are the same, except for one.  Notice the difference? <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/636/a3f/715/636a3f7152b0a1a127779f31834f74f7.jpg"></div><br><br>  The color rendition index is not indicated anywhere on the big box, but “Ra 80” is written on the right side of the little one and this is no accident!  These two T5FV15ELC lamps with the same bar code 6925587213046 have a very serious difference: the one released in May has a CRI (Ra) color rendering index of only 72 and this light is better not to use in residential areas, and the lamp in a small box released in July The CRI (Ra) is 82.5 and it is quite a comfortable light. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/79a/c07/4d3/79ac074d3412c439b2f3eb5d41c0a17d.jpg"></div><br><br>  It turns out that every buyer of these lamps participates in a lottery - it is not known in advance what kind of lamps they will get - good or not.  In this case, got different. <br><br>  But two filament "balls", at first glance, are different - one of the Premium series, and the other not. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/755/4e8/56d/7554e856d63d76822448f44ab4150019.jpg"></div><br><br>  For the price they are also different.  All the parameters indicated on the boxes are completely similar and there is only one difference: on the back of the Premium lamp box it says “0% ripple”, and there is no such label on the box of the other lamp. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8f3/56a/2bb/8f356a2bb34141fe732e856ccda37da1.jpg"></div><br><br>  By analogy with the previous lamp, it can be assumed that the second lamp will have a high level of light pulsation.  But no, in fact, the bulbs are exactly the same, they differ only in the inscription. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e8a/314/c32/e8a314c32e4504deab52aa1b5ae5bd09.png"></div><br><br>  However, it must be understood that in the next or previous batch a lamp on which nothing is written about the absence of a ripple may well have light with a ripple. <br><br>  And two more lamp-pills.  This time, exactly the same, but very unique. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5be/9c7/d2d/5be9c7d2d1d02ced90c134e51627ebac.jpg"></div><br><br>  The radiator of the lamp protrudes backwards, so it cannot be installed in a standard cartridge.  But this is not the main thing. <br>  When I turned them on, I was very surprised - the light was completely blue.  The spectrometer showed an insane color temperature in excess of 22,000 K. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6fc/155/752/6fc1557527a6fc68ff6e0fa936973f11.jpg"></div><br><br>  You should not use such lamps even in a shed.  I can not imagine how this can be produced and sold. <br><br>  And the last two lamps are 6 W and 5 W filament candles.  The first one shows the luminous flux of 570-600 lm, the second 470-500 lm.  What do you think is brighter? <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/907/9c3/323/9079c332300a74503e1993e1e33478c9.jpg"></div><br><br>  Do not guess!  For some reason, the six-watt one consumes more, gives less light. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/985/c27/bef/985c27befdd20bc4a5a279c675f04554.png"></div><br><br>  It is possible that other instances of the same lamp models would give different results. <br><br>  In conclusion, I will give a table of all Ecola lamps tested in 2018. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1b7/7e9/ed6/1b77e9ed63c32e64f258bf51d8164f3c.png"></div><br><br>  On a powerful industrial lamp, giving 6137 lm, I will soon tell you separately.
