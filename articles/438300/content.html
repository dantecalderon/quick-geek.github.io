<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  December 29, 2018 <a href="https://rkn.gov.ru/personal-data/register/%3Fid%3D77-18-012781">Apple Rus LLC was</a> entered into the register of personal data operators of Roskomnadzor.  This means that Apple complied with the Russian requirements for the storage of personal data of users in the country, transferred the information to the Russian data center and appointed the person responsible for the processing of personal data of Russians (Kotilevsky Alexander Vyacheslavovich). <br><br>  The register contains the date of commencement of the processing of personal data: December 29, 2011, and the categories of subjects whose personal data are processed.  Among them are the final buyers of Apple products. <br><br>  To store the data, the company <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/news/top/2019-01-30_apple_stala_operatorom_personalnyh_dannyh_v">rented</a> part of the racks of the Ixcellerate data center, and the Booking.com files, which collect Russians passport data for booking hotels, are also stored there. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The registry lists the categories of personal data of Apple consumers: last name, first name, middle name, mailing address (shipping address), email address, phone number. <br><br>  The list of actions with personal data: collection, recording, systematization, accumulation, storage, refinement (update, change), retrieval, use, transfer (distribution, provision, access), blocking, deletion, destruction, carried out as using automation (automated processing), and without the use of such funds (non-automated processing). <br><br>  Similar actions Apple has taken in China.  In February 2018, the company <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/417559/">decided to</a> transfer iCloud user data to Chinese data centers, subject to local law.  The company stressed that the legislation applies only to residents of mainland China, who chose China as their main country of residence when registering an Apple account.  Requirements do not apply to residents of Hong Kong, Macau or Taiwan, as well as all other Chinese who have indicated a different location as the “main country”. <br><br>  According to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/17/apples-icloud-user-data-in-china-is-now-handled-by-a-state-owned-mobile-operator/">recommendations of</a> human rights defenders, in such a situation the safest option is to create a new Apple account indicating another country. <br><br><blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jy/sd/rr/jysdrr7tqgfjt50wtcshw89ctho.png" align="left"><h3>  Minute of care from UFO </h3><br>  This material could cause contradictory feelings, so before writing a comment, refresh something important in your memory: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How to write a comment and survive</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  Do not write abusive comments, do not go to the person. </li><li>  Refrain from using obscene language and toxic behavior (even in a veiled form). </li><li>  To report comments that violate the rules of the site, use the "Report" button (if available) or <a href="https://habr.com/feedback/%3Ftype%3D4">a feedback form</a> . </li></ul><br>  What to do if: <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/karma/">minus karma</a> |  <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/sandbox/">blocked account</a> <br><br>  → <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/other/">Code of authors Habra</a> and <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/other/">habraetiket</a> <br>  → <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/rules/">Full site rules</a> </div></div></blockquote></div>
