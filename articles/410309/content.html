The basis of this system is 512Gb <a href="http://www.userbenchmark.com/Faq/What-s-the-difference-between-NAND-and-V-NAND/104">V-NAND memory</a> .  According to representatives of the corporation, drives of this type are necessary for the next-generation corporate systems; ordinary user models will not be released yet. <br><br>  The V-NAND technology used to create the hard core is characterized by 64-layers, 3-bit cell and 512 Gigabit chips.  Compared with previous models, new drives are twice as capacious.  By the way, the corporation began producing SSD with a capacity of 15 TB in March 2016.  At that time it was a record capacity model. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The new solid-state computer uses a combination of 32 new NAND flash packets of 1 TB, each of which consists of 16 packaged layers of 512 Gigabit V-NAND memory chips.  The technology made it possible to store a huge number of different files on one disk.  Thus, the 30-TB model allows you to store 5,700 movies with a capacity of 5 gigabytes in Full HD resolution.  The geometrical dimensions of the disk have not changed - it is still the same 2.5 inches. <br><br>  It is worth noting that the model PM1643 boasts not only increased capacity, but also increased productivity.  This figure is almost twice the performance of the previous generation of drives - Samsung SAS SSD high-capacity models.  The PM1643 hard drive interface is SAS, and the bandwidth is 12 Gbps.  As for reading the record, these two indicators are 400,000 and 50,000 I / O operations per second (IOPS).  This is an arbitrary read and write.  In the case of sequential speeds, the other is 2100 MB / s and 1700 MB / s, respectively. <br><br>  According to these indicators, the disk is almost four times the characteristics of a random read and three times the sequential reading of a conventional 2.5-inch SSD and SATA SSD format. <br><br>  “The commencement of the production of our 30.72 TB disk allows us to reach a new level, beyond the limits of capacity indicators of corporate data warehouses.  And this allows us to achieve ultra-high capacity in data centers, ”said Jesuu Khan, executive vice president at Samsung Electronics.  He also said that the company plans to further develop this area, creating solid-state products for corporations with a capacity exceeding 10 TB. <br><br>  Koreans have long been working on improving features such as storage capacity and performance.  New horizons, so to speak, have been achieved thanks to the creation of a new efficient controller architecture, which integrates nine controllers from the previous model range into a single whole.  It should be noted that the new drive uses <a href="https://toshiba.semicon-storage.com/us/company/taec/news/2015/08/memory-20150825-1.html">TSV</a> technology (holes in silicon) in order to connect 8 GB DDR4 chips.  The result is 10 4 GB of TSV DRAM packets with a total of 40 GB of DRAM memory. <br><br>  Another improvement is advanced software supporting metadata protection.  Information becomes possible to recover after an unplanned power outage.  Plus, this drive provides increased reliability when recording a full drive per day.  And this is the ability to record the entire volume of the disk every day during the 5 year warranty period.  The mean time between failures (MTBF) and the PM1643 drive is quite good and amounts to two million hours. <br><br>  According to the technology used to make solid-core solids, Koreans are also going to make other disk models with volumes of 15.36 TB, 7.68 TB, 3.84 TB, 1.92 TB, 960 GB and 800 GB.  According to representatives of the company, all this will gradually get away from the idea of ​​using conventional HDD to work with SSD.  Less capacious and not so expensive solid-state drives will be available not only to corporations, but also to ordinary users who will also be able to increase the performance of their system by improving the qualities of SSD.  Well, the corporate sector will be able to meet their needs for reliable and efficient data storage. </div>
