Companies can use them for data exchange and verification. <br><br>  The terms of transactions are programmed using smart contracts, and the blockchain technology is used to speed up settlements.  For example, the technology is used when issuing syndicated loans and when trading in mortgage bonds. <br><br><h2>  Plans </h2><br>  Among other things, the startup has entered into a partnership agreement with a large fund Vanguard Group - in the framework of cooperation it is planned to introduce the blockchain into the calculations of index data for mutual funds. <br><br>  Among other things, Symbiont uses borrowed money for development in the areas of data management, the mortgage market, private equity and the further development of products for the syndicated loan niche. <br><br>  Nasdaq exchanges plans to use the Assembly platform for transactions of new and existing customers, as well as asset tokenization, that is, the translation of operations with real resources like oil or precious metals into digital form. <br><br><h2>  Other materials on finance and stock market from <a href="https://iticapital.ru/">ITI Capital</a> : </h2><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://hello.iticapital.ru/">Western securities analysis tool</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://iticapital.ru/research-education/research/">Analytics and market reviews</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://iticapital.ru/shares/american-shares/">Purchase of shares of American companies from Russia</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/iticapital/blog/419213/">Huawei overtook Apple in terms of sales.</a>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/iticapital/blog/419213/">The capitalization of the American company still reached $ 1 trillion</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/iticapital/blog/418605/">Analysts: Microsoft's capitalization could reach $ 1 trillion</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/iticapital/blog/417587/">Mass media: large-scale cyber attacks accelerated the growth of capitalization of companies from the information security industry</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/iticapital/blog/416457/">Bloomberg: Hedge Funds Recognize Brexit Results Before Others And Earn Billions</a> </li></ul></div>
