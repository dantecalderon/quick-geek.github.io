On the inner surface of this tank, place the guns for salutes.  Place also additional guns arbitrarily inside the tank, turning the guns in all directions.  Load cannons with “ribbons” of shots.  Now these guns shoot in different directions with different frequency.  Inside the tank, salutes appear here and there.  They “cross over”, i.e.  one salute ball can pass through the other.  They "touch".  They "catch up" with each other. <br><br>  Submitted? <br><br>  All this happens continuously over billions of years.  Salutes flash and continue to burn too billions of years.  Every fireworks, every ball of fireworks is one universe.  Each glowing salute point is a cluster of galaxies. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This to some extent coincides with the multiverse hypothesis of Dr.  Laura Mersini-Houghton (University of North Carolina).  She argues that the anomalies in the structure of our universe are best explained by the gravity of other universes. <br><br>  To some extent, the beauty of this hypothesis is that the universe becomes “transparent”, permeable to other universes, and this unites huge galaxies and stars with microscopic quanta.  Those.  Perhaps on such a huge scale as the interaction of the universes, laws will appear very similar to the laws of the quantum world.  This will eliminate the existing contradictions in physics. <br><br>  It is also possible that we perceive the places of intersection of universes as dark matter. <br><br>  Why? <br><br>  Imagine that in our universe a salute ball consists only of green lights, whereas in the universes crossing us, salutes consist of blue, yellow, red, etc.  But at the same time we perceive only the green color.  Others just do not see.  Whether because of the orientation of one universe relative to another, or because of a different fundamental difference. <br><br>  This assumption is the weakest point in the Theory of Salutes, since  there is a lot of dark matter in our universe and if the theory is correct, then other universes should cross ours everywhere.  This, of course, can be imagined, but it is hard to believe.  And it should probably give a much larger number of gravitational deviations than we know so far. <br><br><h3>  How is the shot? </h3><br>  There are two options. <br><br><h4>  The first </h4><br>  The gun in our example is not only invisible, but also extremely small and resembles, rather, a spherical spring. <br><br>  What is this spring? <br><br>  This is a bunch of quantum energies.  Those.  in the case of Big Bang, it was not the mass in the usual sense that exploded, but something like an energy spring. <br><br>  Those.  the spring, which twisted the space by the gravitational interaction to incredibly small sizes, could not continue to twist and exploded, unwound. <br><br>  Untwisted, too, not just because, as the compression was heterogeneous in density, a little "uneven."  So a small defect inside the metal spring material causes a breakdown.  A little harder pressed and the spring burst. <br><br>  Energy was twisted around itself, as it were, not around some kind of central particle.  Like a Mobius strip.  Or like a snake, but not around the victim, but just like that. <br><br>  An incredibly high pressure destroyed all the particles that were present, including atoms and subatomic structures.  Therefore, there were no particles.  There were only quanta in the "aggregate state" of the wave. <br>  Actually, the universe can be squeezed for quite a long time, since its main component is emptiness.  Even in every atom there is more emptiness than matter. <br><br>  Big Bang is less like a huge firecracker blast.  Most likely, even if it happens next to us, we will not see and hear.  We will simply be blown away, discarded by an energyless, soundless and colorless wave. <br><br>  Indeed, in the first 380 thousand years after Big Bang there was no light.  At all.  Just because the first photons appeared only 380 thousand years after Big Bang. <br><br>  The theory of "spring" to some extent, possibly, coincides with Andrei Dmitrievich Linde's hypothesis about the inflationary model of the universe.  Because it transforms the Big Bang from a mass point into a volume containing energy. <br><br>  In order to understand Big Bang and its speeds (initially quantum), the concept of time must be removed from the reflections and formulas, replacing it with the concept of "now, now, at this moment."  Earth is absolutely not important time, it is important only the mass and distance to other objects.  The rest of the objects - from atoms to galaxies - too. <br><br>  And component C in the formula E = MC2 is the distance in time.  Since time needs to be removed, the square of the distance remains. <br><br>  If the concept of speed is changed by distance per unit, then you get this. <br>  Mass can not be equal to zero.  Time cannot be zero. <br><br>  So  time is always “now” = one, and mass = any value other than zero. <br>  Then the distance, which is squared, for the electron is equal to the diameter of the orbit of rotation around the proton, for any quantum - the distance between the extreme points of possible detection.  And that explains quantum speeds when one quantum interacts with another. <br><br>  So  the conditional "speed of interaction of quanta", "speed of communication, transfer of information to each other" between quanta exceeds the speed of light.  And, probably, many times. <br>  Perhaps the speed of light is the limit of the “aggregative state” of a quantum.  And quanta can exist as particles only at speeds less than the speed of light. <br><br>  And this speed has not gone away.  It is real and it is in us and around us.  And this speed is m.  used to communicate at interstellar distances. <br><br>  Big Bang, usually depicted by the plane of the funnel, is actually a sphere. <br><br>  We are in one part of this sphere, in its thickness.  As in a brilliant layer of a soap bubble, as in a rubber balloon, in the “thicker” imaginary sphere of salute.  We see neighboring points, but we cannot see the opposite side, as it is impossible to see New York from Moscow. <br><br>  London is possible if you build a giant tower.  America is impossible. <br><br>  Thus, the Universe has a certain area of ​​the “surface” of a sphere and a certain thickness, which is probably equal to the CMB radiation. <br><br>  At the same time, other Big Bang can occur regularly in the same place where ours happened.  Where our imaginary gun stands. <br><br>  Moving away from the center of Big Bang, the universe leaves behind no void, just as there is no void inside the ball. <br><br>  Quanta are worn inside at a speed exceeding the speed of light and a mass barely distinguishable from zero. <br><br>  This leads to the fact that these elements always exist as waves. <br><br>  But having mass, they also have attraction. <br><br>  They did not fly away from the center of Big Bang, along with the rest of the universe, since the colliding interactions did not direct them from, but along or toward the center of the explosion. <br><br>  As a result, their masses and speeds begin to interact in the manner of a spring entangled in a tangle. <br><br>  Since there is no Swiss watchmaker, the voltage in different areas of this spring is non-uniform, which leads to the next Big Bang after the spring is compressed to “explosive” dimensions. <br><br>  Relic radiation can, among other things, reflect the non-uniformity of the voltage of this “spring”.  To be a remote echo of this tension. <br><br>  Thus, inside the “balloon” of our Universe, new Universes are constantly being formed, which expand like ours, but which are not visible to us as well as the opposite side of our Universe. <br><br>  Those.  we are now like the inhabitants of the Earth, who believed that the earth is flat.  After all, everything is flat.  Represent America, while in Europe, is impossible.  See too.  For this you need to fly around the whole Earth. <br><br>  At the same time, from the center of the Universe, where we are also technically unable to look, our expanding Universe is being caught up by new Universes. <br><br><h4>  The second option "shot" or Big Bang </h4><br>  "The adjoining universes." <br><br>  Imagine two containers with different pressures inside each.  Now connect them with a tube. <br>  Everything in a tank with high pressure, will rush into the tank with less.  Only one way. <br><br>  This will continue for some time ... <br><br>  And time is different ... For example, millions of years. <br><br>  And black holes in space are constantly sucking the substance into their “tube”. <br><br>  Now let us imagine two universes connected by a “black hole” tube.  We are in "capacity", i.e.  the universe, with high pressure.  And therefore, in the black hole, if we look from our side, everything disappears, stretches into the universe "from the other side of the tube."  This happens quite quickly in space and very slowly, relative to us. <br>  And now let's imagine a lot of soap bubbles blown at the same time.  Or constantly blown out, but not flying away, but touching one another and one bubble (the universe) may be in contact with many other universes.  Border.  And on this border there can be a black hole. <br><br>  However ... the extinguished star “interferes”, shrinking to micro-dimensions, which is located in the center of the black hole.  And perhaps continues to shrink and collapse to the state of "spring" to give birth to a new Big Bang. <br><br>  But we do not know if it is there, or if it has passed into another universe along the “tube”. <br>  We don’t even know if this universe is there and why the pressure (density of matter) is “there” lower than “here”. <br><br>  Theoretically, then at some moment there should be an incredible expansion of a black hole and the merging of two universes.  (As if two soap bubbles became one).  Or, on the contrary, the black hole “collapses” and the super-small star just flies into another universe, “closing the door behind it”. <br><br>  If the universes (bubbles) unite, the two universes become one, this will lead to the "escape" of galaxies, relative to the observer in each of them.  Get an expanding universe.  What, in fact, is observed. <br><br>  Perhaps such mergers occur constantly, and somewhere, strongly distorting the space, there are several excessively heavy "springs" of former stars, preparing to produce new Big Bangs. <br><br>  Maybe the "tube" occurs when two ultra-small stars of two black holes from different universes approach each other, turn out to be in the same "tube".  Then they collide in order for a new (regular) Big Bang to occur. <br><br>  The weak point of this hypothesis is that something must be absorbed into our universe from others through black holes in these universes.  And this is not like.  Or is there?  And this something is exactly dark matter and dark energy? <br><br>  At the same time, this hypothesis is close to the theory of Lee Smolin that the Universes arise from the explosion of "singularity" inside black holes. <br><br>  And it, since it is a question of the contact of the universes, is probably close to Neil Turok’s theory of the birth of the Universes as a result of collisions of "branes" (multidimensional membranes in string theory). <br><br>  At the same time, the version of the “spring” does not contradict the hypothesis of Roger Penrose, who admits at the moment that there was something before Big Bang. <br><br>  Thus, the main beauty of the theory of salutes is that it combines all existing hypotheses. <br><br>  Backwardness mathematics check its formulas. </div>
