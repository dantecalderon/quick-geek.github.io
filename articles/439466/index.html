<br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_u/js/de/_ujsdemih2dzzuzwwb5ayo4n1_m.jpeg"><br><br>  - Yuytu-2 rover (height 1 meter, width 1 meter (without solar batteries), 1.5 meters in length, two folding solar panels, six wheels, weight 140 kg.). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/n2/wp/pf/n2wppf_slamm0evl9jjawfgll0i.jpeg"><br><br>  And here is how the LRO probe earlier took pictures of the Chang'e-3 modules on the visible side of the moon. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ss/bz/es/ssbzesmyx_fnwenldvwi1wlbege.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gb/j1/oc/gbj1ocw_umfeadxdgvnve7q9vvi.gif"><br><br>  We are still waiting for new photos from NASA if they can bring the LRO probe to a more successful trajectory for obtaining data at a slightly higher resolution, at least as from Chang'e-3. <br><br>  Also, an updated map of the route of the ‚ÄúYuuta-2‚Äù rover on the lunar surface appeared, and its movement data after the moonlit night was added: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u6/ba/ca/u6bacabx-fe1awycmombngwhzec.jpeg"><br><br>  As you can see, the six-wheeled ‚ÄúYuuta-2‚Äù rover has already traveled more than 70 meters on the surface of the moon, carefully avoiding obstacles. <br><br>  I really hope that in the near future the fate of the first ‚ÄúYuuta‚Äù rover will not suffer. <br><br>  Satellite transponder "Tseyutsyao" sent an interesting photo: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pv/2z/mc/pv2zmci4l9zqlrwuime5ipcix7w.png"><br><br>  The main problem is that the reverse side is never visible from Earth, due to the phenomenon of tidal capture.  This means that there must be a satellite outside the moon for transmitting messages between ground tracking stations and the spacecraft. <br><br>  The Tseutqiao repeater satellite (triage bridge), launched in May 2018, operates in halo-orbit around a special gravitationally stable Lagrange point L2, from which it can maintain direct visibility with the Earth and the lunar back side at any time for the organization radio communication project "Chang'e-4". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/384/fdd/5fb/384fdd5fbf98e61962af46c048a1348a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The Chinese portal "System of publications and collection of scientific data and studies of the lunar and deep space" has also earned, on which the obtained data and images from Chang'e-4 (and earlier missions) will be published and processed. <br>  <a href="http://202.106.152.98:8081/moondata/">Path to the portal</a> : <br>  <a href="http://202.106.152.98:8081/moondata/">http://202.106.152.98:8081/moondata/</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/439466/">https://habr.com/ru/post/439466/</a></p>
