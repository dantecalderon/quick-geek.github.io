<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Introduced at CES 2018, the Xperia XA2 Ultra smartphone has become one of the representatives of the second-generation Sony middle class smartphones.  In the new version, the manufacturer focused on increasing power and autonomy, improving ergonomics by transferring the fingerprint scanner to the back panel and an advanced front camera for selfie.  Now two Exmor RS and Exmor R modules with conventional and wide-angle optics are installed above the screen, and a flash also appeared.  We tell, what else is this smartphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qa/bi/4t/qabi4tcet2hieejjg3cnchhuoou.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The appearance of the Sony Xperia XA2 Ultra uses a proprietary concept of symmetry Loop Surface body and front panel design without side frames, like other members of the line Xperia XA.  Protective glass display on wide sides rests on the metal frame.  Inserts remained in the upper and lower parts of the case, but their area has decreased in comparison with previous generations.  The back panel is made of high-quality and practical matte plastic, while visually and tactile it is difficult to distinguish it from the metal of the side frame, which makes the appearance of the Sony Xperia XA1 Plus monolithic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pa/g4/l-/pag4l-qsrahhmngke5bzj15vb7a.jpeg"><br><br>  On the front side above the screen is a notification indicator, a speaker, the Sony logo, two front-facing cameras and a flash, and an ambient light sensor on either side of it.  Under the screen - a microphone cutout similar to the dynamics.  On the upper side are the mini-jack for connecting headphones and an auxiliary microphone of the noise cancellation system, the bottom is a USB Type-C connector and a main speaker.  The rear panel in the new model received a barely noticeable bend.  Under the module of the main camera is now a fingerprint scanner, it was transferred to the back of the power button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ue/js/8f/uejs8fw7og87iiyohlpo8sttzye.jpeg"><br><br>  On the right side is the volume button, the power button and start the camera.  The variable thickness of the rounded metal frame (it is slightly wider than the front panel) has a positive effect on the ergonomics of the device.  If you take the smartphone with one hand and put the little finger to the bottom for a better grip, the sides of the case do not dig into the skin and allow you to comfortably hold the device even for a long time.  On the left side there is only a slot for SIM-cards and a memory card.  Sony uses three slots, not a hybrid design, when the user is forced to choose between a second SIM card and a memory card.  Dual tray for nano-SIM extends with the lid, microSD are installed next to the case. <br><br>  <b>Screen</b> <br><br>  The Xperia XA2 Ultra is set to a high-quality IPS-matrix with a diagonal of 6 inches and a resolution of 1080x1920 pixels.  For protection, use Corning Gorilla Glass with smoothly rounded edges (2.5D effect).  Traditionally, for this type of matrix, the viewing angles are close to the maximum, even with a significant deviation of the device from the line of sight, there are no significant distortions.  The color rendition of the screen is accurate, but with a slight predominance of cold colors.  Customize the display of pictures on the screen and the color temperature can be in the system settings, depending on preferences. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/io/ly/jm/iolyjmly3zvdeevwxxfbjm_tf4k.jpeg"><br><br>  The screen size of the XA2 Ultra is the largest in the Sony Xperia lineup, so this smartphone is aimed at buyers who are interested in multimedia features: watching movies and TV shows, videos on YouTube and Vimeo, editing photos, games and reading.  At the same time, a large display makes a smartphone a useful tool for those who work a lot on the road - it is convenient to view and edit documents, PDF files, various layouts and sketches.  In addition, this contributes to the high resolution of the screen and, as a result, a decent pixel density, even taking into account the diagonal of six inches. <br><br>  <b>Main and front cameras</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ti/hf/j3/tihfj3064vejofp0igubqgijzi8.jpeg"><br><br>  The main Sony Xperia XA2 Ultra camera is an Exmor RS module from a Sony Xperia Z5 smartphone.  Sensor size is 1 / 2.3 inches, resolution - 23 megapixels.  Optics use a high-aperture, 24mm f / 2.0 aperture wide-angle lens.  The camera is implemented proprietary digital image stabilization SteadyShot, as well as fast hybrid autofocus.  Due to the high resolution of the sensor, the smartphone supports the Clear Image Zoom function - a fivefold digital zoom without loss of quality.  Traditionally for Sony smartphones on the right side in the lower part there is a dedicated button for quick launch of the camera and release the shutter.  From pressing the key to the shooting takes only 0.6 seconds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/n7/t0/ul/n7t0ulp5cu-qgir-yahhngshucu.jpeg"><br><br>  A key feature of the smartphone is a double selfie camera consisting of a 16 megapixel Exmor RS module with an f / 2.0 aperture and a viewing angle of 88 °, and a 120 ° ultra-wide-angle optics module, built on the basis of an 8 megapixel Exmor R f / 2.4 sensor.  Also on the front of the smartphone is an LED flash for taking photos in low light conditions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_i/t1/9h/_it19h7f8uptxvbftsqoho3wwu4.jpeg"><br><br>  The design of the two modules significantly expands the ability to take portraits, because users have the opportunity to choose between single and group photographs depending on the viewing angle, and also include one of the two front-facing cameras depending on lighting conditions.  Exmor RS transmits more light and has optical stabilization, so it is better suited for pictures at dusk or when it is important to get the maximum quality, Exmor R allows several people to fit comfortably in a photo at the same time or capture as much background as possible. <br><br>  <b>Performance</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/to/au/mk/toaumk-u5_nx46kmfv1uaoq58d0.jpeg"><br><br>  Sony Xperia XA2 Ultra is based on a productive and energy-efficient 64-bit Qualcomm Snapdragon 630 processor in combination with 4 GB of RAM.  In terms of synthetic benchmarks AnTuTu performance, this configuration gets about 87,000 points.  The power of the smartphone is enough for any task, be it comfortable working with the interface and standard applications, installing and using any third-party software from Google Play, as well as launching even demanding games.  In the latter case, it is worth paying attention to the graphics settings in order to achieve an insignificant increase in quality to achieve the optimal number of frames per second, but if we talk about games in general, there are no limitations. <br><br>  <b>Autonomy</b> <br><br>  The Xperia XA2 Ultra is equipped with a non-removable 3580 mAh battery - the most capacious in the line of Sony smartphones.  For charging, a symmetrical USB Type-C connector is used, and support for Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 technology allows you to get a charge in the shortest time for prolonged use of the device.  Despite the high-capacity battery and very high battery life, the new smartphone also uses Sony’s proprietary technologies to increase battery life: Smart Stamina reduces power consumption on days when long hours without recharging are most important and with a significant reduction in charge by turning off some of the least significant features and optimize performance, Ultra Stamina significantly extends performance with minimal device functionality in critical situations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cp/ec/vv/cpecvvv9gyxmtuzo1m0vnms-bwk.jpeg"><br><br>  The Xperia XA2 Ultra uses developments from Sony's flagship battery care models and Qnovo Adaptive Charging, which provide smartphone charging in accordance with user scenarios to reduce battery wear and extend service life without loss of efficiency.  Smart algorithms in real time monitor and adjust the current level, and also allow you to charge your smartphone in several stages with a long connection to the network, for example, at night.  In this case, a quick charge of up to 90% occurs, then the process stops and the charge level is maintained, and the remaining 10% of the smartphone dials shortly before the user-set alarm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dy/yc/e-/dyyce-on9j9ebtma5ipkl2hdvok.jpeg"><br><br><blockquote>  <b>Specifications Sony Xperia XA2 Ultra</b> <br><br>  Operating system: Android Oreo (Xperia UI) <br>  Screen: IPS, 6 inches, Full HD (1080p) <br>  Safety glass: 2.5D Corning Gorilla Glass <br>  Processor: 64-bit Qualcomm Snapdragon 630 <br>  RAM: 4 GB <br>  Storage: 32 GB <br>  Memory card support: microSD up to 256 GB <br>  Main camera: Exmor RS 23 megapixel, hybrid autofocus, wide angle lens f / 2.0 <br>  Front-facing cameras: 16 megapixel Exmor RS f / 2.0 at 88 ° with optical stabilization;  8 Mp Exmor R f / 2.4 at 120 °;  flash <br>  Audio: 3.5 mm jack, Bluetooth 5, aptX / A2DP <br>  Mobile connection: two nano-SIM, 2G / 3G / 4G (cat.12) <br>  Wireless connections: A-GNSS, Wi-Fi (a / b / g / n / ac), Bluetooth 5, NFC <br>  Connector: USB Type-C <br>  Battery: 3580 mAh, quick charge Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 <br>  Fingerprint scanner: on the back <br>  Body colors: black, silver, blue, gold <br>  Dimensions: 163 x 80 x 9.5 mm <br>  Weight: 221 g. </blockquote></div>
