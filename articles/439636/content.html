<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Contrary to the widely tolerated programs of zero tolerance for road accident victims, the number of fatalities in the world continues to grow.  And not only at the expense of the third world countries, but also at the expense of countries implementing Vision Zero, where lately the number of the dead has ceased to decline and even began to grow.  On the face of a clear crisis direction.  Let us examine its causes by analyzing the main generally accepted concepts of improving road safety (RTS) and consider a new concept: <br><br><ol><li>  Tougher penalties </li><li>  Enhance security by improving transport and infrastructure </li><li>  Enhancing security through the reduction of transport and infrastructure (Vision Zero) </li><li>  The prospect of replacing a human driver with a computer </li><li>  New concept: “Instead of a safe car, a safe transport system” </li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hi/zj/zg/hizjzgbycj4zcmgfmlptocyrs6w.jpeg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><cut text="Итак, вперёд, в безопасное автомобильное будущее!"><br><h3>  about the author </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vo/4q/y0/vo4qy0gtns8l-s7vgwtsrwxmgy8.jpeg" align="left">  Author: Roman Krivosheev, inventor. <br><br>  The head of the team "ITS SPRUT" of the participant of the technological competition NTI "Winter City", the site <a href="http://upgreat.one/">upgreat.one</a> competition. <br><br>  The author is the inventor of a fundamentally new approach to solving transport problems, and accordingly, the primary source of the information presented.  Project site <a href="http://ekologurban.livejournal.com/">ekologurban.livejournal.com</a> <br>  Since the project has several dozen innovations with no analogues in the world, a series of articles is planned. <br><br>  This is the first (overview) article from the cycle.  All pictures are clickable. <br><br><h3>  Analysis of existing road safety concepts </h3><br>  Historically, the first concept was tougher penalties.  Its inefficiency has become apparent long ago: even all the fines put together, plus the execution of the perpetrators, will not be able to resurrect any of those killed in an accident.  And any tightening works for three years, after which the person gets used to it and everything returns to the beginning.  That is, the first concept does not work at all. <br><br>  By the 60s of the twentieth century, it was impossible to put up with a rapid increase in the number of dead, and automakers began to seriously improve the safety of cars (seat belts, airbags, ABS, etc.).  And the cars themselves began to do, taking into account the deformation zones.  In the road infrastructure appeared bump stops and separation barriers.  By the nineties, it became clear that the physical limit of passive safety of cars had been reached.  That is why, with the allowed speed of 110 km / h, crash tests <br>  held at a speed of only 60 km / h.  Thus, the second concept was very effective, but its possibilities are almost completely exhausted. <br><br>  Realizing this, at the turn of the millennium, instead of searching for a new concept of improving transport, transport populists engaged in fraud and began to LOSS the characteristics of transport and infrastructure.  It was stated that cars drive too fast and this speed should be reduced in every way by both administrative and infrastructural measures.  At the forefront of this concept was Sweden, which in 1997 adopted a program known as Vision Zero.  The goal was declared "zero tolerance" for deaths in road accidents, with the goal of reaching zero levels by 2020.  In the year to 2020, it is clear that this program has completely failed. <br><br>  If you take the majority of articles on Vision Zero, then the “future growth” security schedule will end in 2010 or 2013.  Why?  And because after 2013 the program Vision Zero stopped working!  The death toll has ceased to decline and fluctuates around 2013 values.  Moreover, the forecast graph, for the statistically significant last 5 years, in Sweden gives a potential zero only by the year 2410! <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xn/ko/j0/xnkoj0i9qpg8ocyamce41to1x04.png"></a> <br><br>  But the main problem is not this, since it was still possible to achieve a serious reduction in the number of dead.  The main problem is that the success of Vision Zero is greatly exaggerated, and the methods in general are frauds.  Since the reduction in the number of victims of accidents is achieved not due to an increase in SAFETY, but due to the DEGRADATION of the characteristics of the transport and transport infrastructure.  But this is the same as improving the safety of the saw by dulling its teeth.  Yes, it will be safer, but due to the fact that it will become worse to cut.  And this is the essence of all Vision Zero offers!  See for yourself, all four Vision Zero directions are such frauds: <br><br><ol><li>  Vision Zero requires to reduce the speed of transport to a safe 50 or even 30 km / h.  But this is absurd!  Let us then immediately reduce the speed to zero, or ban cars altogether.  No cars, no dead from cars.  That is, the best medicine is the guillotine.  But before that (in the second concept), solutions were developed to increase safety without reducing speed. </li><li>  Vision Zero offers to physically spread pedestrians and vehicles, making all pedestrian crossings off-street.  Yes, pedestrian safety will increase, but at the expense of reducing the convenience of pedestrians.  And for older people in general fatal, since not every person can physically go up to the third floor, and then descend.  And the tremendous price of extra-public transitions forced us to abandon this idea even in small and rich Sweden.  However, in many countries, nodding at Vision Zero, they continue to attack the same rake. </li><li>  Vision Zero offers all country roads to do with the separation barrier in the middle.  The idea is good, only for overtaking opportunities, all roads will have to be made in four lanes (two lanes in each direction).  But it turned out to be too expensive even for small and rich Sweden.  Therefore, we decided to save money and do not four, but three-lane roads with a “meandering lane”.  Has security improved?  Yes, it has risen, only it is silent, because of this, throughput has decreased on the THIRD!  Paid for three bands, and bandwidth is equal to two bands. </li><li>  Discrimination motorists.  Here, without comment, any discrimination is unacceptable.  But the principle of fraud is the same, improving one at the expense of the other. </li></ol><br>  Yes, of course, safety is above all and expensive, but you have to understand that Vision Zero solutions are very inefficient and are not a problem treatment, but only expensive crutches.  The problem is that these solutions are promoted as almost ideal and are literally imposed on other countries as having no alternatives.  In particular, these ideas are spelled out in the Russian NTI road maps, and on this basis other concepts of improving road safety are simply not considered. <br><br>  The fraudulent essence of Vision Zero is not a secret.  And in many countries, for example in the United States, the imposition of this program encounters active resistance from people who disagree with the program “Hush going, you will continue, from the place where you go.” <br><br>  If you look at the safety charts of the rich countries of the world, we will see that the death toll has stabilized everywhere and stopped falling (a slight increase in the United States is associated with a significant increase in car mileage due to cheap gasoline, and the death toll per unit mileage does not change and in the USA).  Yes, this stabilization occurred for different countries at different levels.  And this level directly depends on the INTENSITY of using cars in different countries.  Not everyone in the 21st century wants to live in the rhythm of a 19th century village at the speed of a pedestrian.  Namely, this is the meaning of Vision Zero - to make the speed of transport commensurate with the speed of a pedestrian and a bicycle. <br><br>  Fortunately, lately (2020 is just around the corner), the failure of the Vision Zero program has become indirectly recognized even in Sweden.  First, the dates were postponed, and then the struggle to achieve zero transformed into a movement in the direction of zero.  However, the statistics for the last 5 years clearly shows that even the movement to zero is no longer.  Thus, the concept of Vision Zero is a fraud.  Moreover, the most important thing is that even this fraud has already stopped working. <br><br>  Therefore, now they have increasingly begun to talk about the role of autopilot in improving road safety.  And already here and now.  But in this case we are also talking about fraud.  Statements that autopilot is not based on facts are better than humans (since there is no autopilot yet, there can be no evidence that it is better than humans).  And all the PR is built on Ilona Mask's “Wishbones” and his frauds with statistics.  But the statistics that when using autopilot Tesla crashes occur less frequently - this is fraud, since the pseudo-auto pilot works only in simple weather and road conditions when the probability of an accident is extremely low.  Most of the accidents occur in poor conditions, when the pseudo-auto pilot does not work, and, naturally, these accidents do not spoil the statistics of the pseudo auto pilot. <br><br>  So let's see, and how much the concept itself, that “autopilot is better than man” is true.  In fact, the only argument for this is that the computer does not make “human factor” errors.  This is true, as well as the fact that a person does not make mistakes of the “computer factor”.  Thus, the replacement of the "human factor" by the "computer factor" is supposed.  But far from being the fact that the final amount will be positive, especially considering, for example, hackers. <br><br>  There is a reasonable question, why then change the awl on the soap?  Build a table: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/la/e5/iw/lae5iw7nd4meectx6bzw_zjpqhg.png"></a> <br><br>  Moreover, the shortcomings of the autopilot cannot be solved in principle, since they require not just a strong AI, but a strong artificial CONSCIOUSNESS.  And he is not even in the project, but even if it appears, he will have all the rights of the PERSONAL, and it’s far from a fact that he wants to work for a person. <br><br>  Thus, with formal even equality of the pros and cons of the person and the autopilot, PR people are trying to convince us that the autopilot is much safer than a person! <br><br>  Even the PR people themselves began to understand this, and at CES-2019 they recognized that the fifth level of autonomy, the cause of a distant future, must be concentrated on the third level of autonomy ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/437532/">Robotic mobile industry is finally becoming more realistic</a> ).  Thus, by 2019, it became obvious that the promising concept of increasing security at the expense of the autopilot was at least postponed for an indefinite time. <br><br>  To summarize: all existing and promising concepts for improving road safety have exhausted themselves and will not be able to significantly increase safety in the near future.  And even a strong AI will not be able to solve the main problem of a promising automatic car, namely the problem of responsibility for making decisions on “stealing” real chaotic traffic with a lack of information. <br><br><h3>  Instead of a safe car, a safe transport system </h3><br>  But not everything is so hopeless!  Analysis of the table shows a very interesting feature: where a person is bad, the computer is good and vice versa.  Then there is a logical idea to make a hybrid, combining the advantages of both approaches and free from their shortcomings.  Thus, the greatest security, with the existing and future level of development of AI, will not be an irresponsible autopilot, but this is a hybrid version: <br><br>  <b>“A person is responsible for everything.</b>  <b>Electronics gives prompts (systems for marking, road signs, blind spots control, etc.) and can execute one last driver command (stay in the lane, change lane, maintain distance, park).</b>  <b>The electronics can block the driver’s unambiguously dangerous actions (emergency braking systems). ”</b> <br><br>  Obviously, this potential option does not guarantee the absence of the dead as well, although the person is responsible for the results of “settling” the existing chaotic traffic, but the results of the “breaking” are very far from ideal.  Moreover, it is impossible to theoretically order CHAOS even theoretically (the task of the trolley).  So we finally found the main road safety problem!  You just need to get rid of this chaos on the roads!  That is, the existing CHAOTIC traffic, when everyone is driving as he wants, and the traffic rules are only of an advisory nature, should be replaced with “initially ordered PLANNED traffic controlled by automatic central dispatching”.  And the plan itself should be designed so that, in principle, there are no ambiguous situations for which it would be necessary to answer.  Thus, the driver is only an executor and is responsible only for the correct execution of the automatic dispatch decisions.  And since the execution of decisions, even a simple computer can be significantly better than a person, a full-fledged automatic car is obtained by itself, as a free by-product, and does not require any intelligence at all. <br><br>  Such a fundamentally new concept is able to completely solve the problems of transport safety here and now, and its one-time cost is several times lower than the annual official damage from road accidents.  This concept was developed by the author and implemented in the Intelligent Transport System of Full Regulation and Transport Management (ITS SPRUT).  Its essence: <b>instead of writing meaningless penalties for traffic violations that have already been committed, we need the well-known “fool protection” system, which will not even allow deliberately to violate the traffic rules.</b>  And although an absolutely safe car is impossible (if you do not crash, you will crash into you), it is easy to create an absolutely safe centralized transport system that can guarantee 100% safety with an accuracy of technical malfunction. <br><br>  A small educational program on the properties of the classical central dispatch: any such system can only be COMPLETE and MANDATORY for all its participants.  However, it turned out that the overwhelming majority of “experts” do not understand this.  Although these properties are fairly obvious: imagine how the central dispatching system at the aerodrome will work if the dispatcher controls only half of the runway, or if at least one pilot will not obey the dispatcher's commands. <br><br><h3>  Consider the principle of "ITS SPRUT" </h3><br>  First, we need complete information about traffic, which cannot be obtained theoretically from a car (there are no technologies installed in a car that can see a child even behind a car).  And no even promising “Car to X” systems will be able to solve the problem, since even theoretically they cannot be complete, and at a certain stage they even DECREASE security. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pv/vg/up/pvvgup3tfppubjcdsou3y7cmimy.jpeg"></a> <br>  <i>(In the center the view from the car, when it is still possible to stop)</i> <br><br>  Therefore, an external system of constant monitoring of all roads, organized on the cellular principle.  "ITS SPRUT" consists of the simplest cameras with a large viewing angle, directed from the top downwards from the existing lighting pillars.  As a result, “ITS SPRUT” in real time has a plan of the top view of all roads, on which in principle there can be no dead zones, since each point is viewed diagonally from four cameras (reliability of duplication at the level of combat fighters).  Thus, the problem of lack of information is completely solved. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6j/xv/g3/6jxvg36vrs-yls6uzfr1kqorere.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  The price of such a system is $ 10,000 per kilometer.  That is, the one-time cost for all of Russia is approximately equal to the annual payments for OSAGO + CASCO, and three times less than the annual official damage from road accidents. <br><br>  Second, to safely resolve all conflict situations, a central dispatch system is needed, as in aviation, only in automatic mode.  That is, all conflict places on the hearse become traffic lights adjustable.  To do this, it is enough to install an “individual traffic light” (IS) in each vehicle with constant two-way communication with ITS SPRUT.  Outside in front of each car is installed LED strip, performing the role of IP for pedestrians.  Thus, the problem of interaction between ALL road users has been completely solved. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/v7/8c/ix/v78cixqoywtusibt-kkrbj0wkzk.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  The cost of IP from three thousand rubles, which is less than the average cost of a child car seat. <br><br>  Therefore, the installation of IP can be made mandatory.  It works like this.  On the IC screen, real-time information is displayed: a plan of the top view, accurate and up-to-date information about navigation, the effect of current road signs, maximum speed, green wave speed and so on.  For convenience, all the information necessary for management is duplicated by voice and LED strips on the principle of traffic lights.  For example, an absolutely safe turn is as follows: including the left turn signal, the driver sends a request for turning to the "ITS SPRUT" system.  After the security check, at the time of the beginning of the turn, the green signal on the LED tape of the left turn lights up.  The horizontal tape determines the speed mode relative to the speed of the green wave, and the blinking frequency determines the deviation.  Consider speeding: let the driver hit the gas.  Having calculated the speed and acceleration, "ITS SPRUT" includes the first warning - red flashing with a large interval, meaning that if we continue acceleration at the same pace, then in a few seconds the permissible speed will be exceeded.  If the driver ignores it, the blinking frequency increases and the second warning is transmitted over the speakerphone.  If his driver ignored, then we have documented objective data that the driver is not able to adequately drive a car.  Therefore, the system "ITS SPRUT" in the car remotely includes emergency braking and sends the nearest special services car to this place. <br><br>  Third, the central dispatch allows you to create an absolutely safe individual RIGHT trajectory for each transport.  This "Customized Route" is ordered and obtained through the IP or the Internet (similar to ordering a taxi).  Previously, each trajectory is checked for safety by virtual graphic modeling, that is, the absence of intersections with the trajectories of other road users.  Moreover, the trajectories are laid so as to completely avoid or at least minimize the consequences of potential technical malfunctions, for example, the possibility of a coup into the oncoming lane of the truck when turning and so on is taken into account in advance.  Thus, the existing unpredictable movement always becomes fully and in advance KNOWN, and the problem of lack of information is completely absent.  That is, instead of the classical FORECASES of trajectories that cannot be exact even theoretically, there is always an absolutely accurate PLAN of all trajectories in ITS SPRUT. <br><br>  Structurally, "ITS SPRUT" is built as a distributed cellular network with hierarchical logistics (similar to cellular networks).  Thus, the system "ITS SPRUT" is scaled almost linearly, but, unlike the cellular telephone network, it is basically impossible to overload.  Since the number of objects within each cell is physically limited by the area of ​​the road. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ku/vk/xz/kuvkxzrhr_haqydf_kuesbkwcne.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  As a result, a system is obtained in which the trajectories of each transport are NOT dependent on other road users.  Accordingly, it is not necessary to predict and predict the actions of other participants.  So you do not have to be responsible for the actions of 3d fools on the road and Baranoped walkers.  In the system "ITS SPRUT" all road users are responsible only for themselves, namely, just for the precise execution of the instructions of the automatic dispatcher.  Thus, the absurd responsibility for the actions of other road users, which in principle cannot be influenced, completely disappears. <br><br>  Since there is a clear and unambiguous traffic plan for each transport, ITS SPRUT can, through an individual traffic light, warn in advance about ALL potentially dangerous situations.  Accordingly, it becomes impossible to accidentally violate traffic rules, and there are NO fines at all, since there is no sense to punish for random and immediately corrected violations. <br><br>  And the fourth, if the driver still ignored the warnings, and, accordingly, intentionally violated the traffic rules, then such a car must be forcibly stopped, and the driver has no alternative to revoke the driver's license.  To do this, it is enough to install a remotely controlled brake in each car (an analogue of the crane stop in trains). <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/os/ms/mo/osmsmoxpnfx_uzibsgpzh4i0kmy.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  Which, in the simplest case, consists of an electric motor rigidly attached to the car body so as not to interfere with the usual brake pedal operation.  The engine is controlled by the system "ITS SPRUT" through an individual traffic light in each car.  This ensures that not only the number of the dead, but also the number of accidents in general, will be reduced to almost zero, up to a technical failure.  Similarly, the problems of rudeness, improper parking and so on are also COMPLETELY solved.  For any car ownership or attempt to drive the wrong parking simply will not receive a PERMISSION from "ITS SPRUT". <br><br>  At the same time, the security of the ITS SPRUT system itself from external hacking is in principle unattainable for existing and prospective systems.  But this is a separate and too big topic.  Therefore, together with the topic of total control and protection of personal data will be discussed in a separate article. <br><br>  All the solutions described were experimentally tested on the full-featured “ITS SPRUT” sample, which is responsible for 120 meters of the road and one intersection.  Consider her work.  Cameras are installed on the balcony of a residential building at the height of the top point of a standard road lighting ceiling (approximately 12 meters).  The task of the ITS SPRUT system is to determine in real time the coordinates of all moving objects within the road network and display them on a plan of the top view to determine the safety of their movement. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hi/zj/zg/hizjzgbycj4zcmgfmlptocyrs6w.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  The figure shows the work of the system SPRUT of three autonomous cells.  Honeycombs are joined with each other with small overlaps, realizing the principle “the object has received, the object has passed”. <br>  At the top of the cell that acts as a server, at the bottom of the cell are one and two clients.  The server additionally draws a plan of the top view.  Principle of operation: 30 times per second, each cell receives from the server a very small batch of coordinates of objects that are in its visibility zone according to data from previous frames.  Then, using the data of the simplest motion detector, specifies the coordinates of each object in the current frame.  Thus, the classical task of recognizing arbitrary three-dimensional objects on a changing three-dimensional background, unsolvable without strong artificial intelligence, we reduced to the task of not even tracking, but of refining the coordinates of objects on a fixed flat background.  That is, as simple as possible and, accordingly, as reliable as possible, requiring a minimum computational power, is significantly less than for encoding video in ip cameras.  Each cell then sends a packet with these specified coordinates to the server.  At the same time, the amount of information transmitted over the network is thousands of times less than with the classical video transmission to a single center.  Accordingly, no need for expensive broadband lines.  The server, having received duplicated information from all the cells, selects the most accurate and generates a new actual package of coordinates of objects, which is displayed in the top view. После этого графически производится проверка дорожной обстановки на безопасность (никакие объекты и их зоны безопасности на схеме вида сверху не должны пересекаться). Затем производится диспетчеризация, то есть, однозначное решение всех спорных ситуаций, например, очерёдности проезда. В результате формируется и передаётся пакет данных для каждого транспорта. Далее, этот цикл повторяется для каждого следующего кадра. <br><br> Для точного определения координат автомобилей достаточно, разместить на верхнем багажнике автомобиля (а в перспективе и непосредственно на крыше) контрастный прямоугольник, что позволит довести надёжность и верифицируемость определения координат до избыточного уровня (лучше одного сантиметра). <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/t1/2t/s6/t12ts6u3d_rawa3gsct1wc3l6gk.jpeg"></a> <br> <i>На фото вид с камеры передвижного варианта инфраструктуры «ИТС СПРУТ»</i> <br><br><h3> Проблема не только в человеческом факторе </h3><br> К сожалению, хаос дорожного движения создаётся не только «человеческим фактором» водителей и пешеходов, но и АБСУРДНЫМИ правилами дорожного движения, которые изначально предусматривают конфликтные ситуации, например, на перекрёстках. Поэтому в рамках концепции «защита от дурака» необходимо изменить правила движения по перекрёсткам так, чтобы конфликтных ситуаций (пересекающихся траекторий) вообще бы не было: <br><br><ol><li> Так как вся дорожная сеть находится под постоянным контролем системы «ИТС СПРУТ», то абсолютно все перекрёстки и пешеходные переходы являются светофорно-регулируемыми. Причём для этого вообще не нужны реальные светофоры, так как все сигналы передаются непосредственно на индивидуальные светофоры в каждый автомобиль. </li><li> Надо отказаться от существующего способа регулировки перекрёстка, когда зелёный горит одновременно всем участникам дорожного движения одного из направлений (прямо, налево, направо + прямо для пешеходов, имеющих приоритет). Эта проблема характерна как для двухфазного, так и четырёхфазного режима светофоров. </li></ol><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ag/wk/h5/agwkh5_imf05m6li29jfec2disk.jpeg"></a> <br><br> Понятно, что при таких конфликтных пересекающихся траекториях ДТП неизбежны. Поэтому необходима новая схема пересечения перекрёстка в которой и автомобили и пешеходы всегда двигаются по максимально безопасным непересекающимся траекториям. Кроме того, такой упорядоченный способ пересечения перекрёстка дополнительно увеличивает пропускную способность перекрёстка от двух до пяти раз и создаёт псевдовыделенную полосу для общественного транспорта на всех магистралях города. Описание этой технологии выходит за рамки данной статьи и будет рассмотрена отдельно. <br><br> Здесь же, в рамках реализации принципа «защита от дурака» отметим, что в данной схеме нет конфликтующих вариантов траекторий (как для автомобилей так и для пешеходов), соответственно и ошибиться невозможно. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/su/xm/7g/suxm7gizcvq2y_iegziynoaevbe.jpeg"></a> <br><br> То есть, 20% ДТП, причиной которых является несоблюдение очерёдности проезда, не смогут произойти даже теоретически. <br><br> Аналогично решается вопрос безопасности пешеходов. Существующий принцип организации пешеходных переходов так, чтобы они не мешали движению автомобилей (через сотни метров друг от друга) ВЫНУЖДАЕТ пешеходов становиться нарушителями, так как риск попасть под машину существенно меньше затрат на лишние сотни метров пути до ближайшего пешеходного перехода. Но способ решения этой проблемы давно известен (если дорожки в парках делать не перпендикулярно и параллельно, а по кратчайшим диагоналям, то никто не будет ходить по газонам, удлиняя себе путь). Поэтому в системе «ИТС СПРУТ», все пешеходные переходы являются светофорно-регулируемыми, причём в абсолютно любом месте, где удобно пешеходам. При этом можно обойтись без дополнительных знаков перехода, записав в ПДД, что регулируемый переход расположен под каждым фонарём освещения, то есть, примерно через каждые 30 метров. Работает это так: пешеход, своё намерение перейти дорогу обозначает остановкой рядом со знаком пешеходного перехода или непосредственно под плафоном дорожного освещения, но вне зоны ожидания общественного транспорта. После чего система «ИТС СПРУТ», соблюдая интервал движения машин и пешеходов, в этом конкретном месте создаёт виртуальный пешеходный переход, передавая красный свет на индивидуальные светофоры машин. И включает зелёный свет на пешеходном ИС в ближайшем к пешеходу автомобиле. Таким образом, ИС полностью и ОДНОЗНАЧНО гарантирует безопасность пешеходов. То есть, в отличие от существующего хаоса, когда сигнал светофора ничего не гарантирует вообще, зелёный свет ИС системы «ИТС СПРУТ» гарантирует безопасность перехода, а красный ВСЕГДА сигнализирует об опасности. <br><br> Так как система «ИТС СПРУТ» постоянно отслеживает весь транспорт, то по каждому автомобилю мы имеем АКТУАЛЬНУЮ и ДОСТОВЕРНУЮ статистическую информацию о его техническом состоянии и заранее сообщаем о необходимости профилактического ремонта. Это полностью решает проблему технического осмотра транспорта. <br><br> Также у нас есть объективная статистическая информация о квалификации каждого водителя, на основании которой и надо выдавать водительские права. А при существенном отклонении таких параметров как время реакции на знаки, точность определения апекса поворота и так далее, можно очень точно определить, способен ли водитель в ТЕКУЩИЙ момент времени адекватно управлять автомобилем. И с точки зрения безопасности, совершенно не важно, пьяный ли водитель, усталый, или в состоянии стресса. В любом случае ему надо запретить управление транспортным средством повышенной опасности. Таким образом, недостаточно квалифицированный водитель не сможет получить права, а пьяный будет заблокирован ещё при выезде с парковки. <br><br> Ни одно ДТП с жертвами не может произойти по причине плохого качества дорог. Все эти ДТП происходят из-за несоответствия скорости качеству дорожного покрытия, что является следствием отсутствия достоверной и заблаговременной информации о дорожной обстановке. «ИТС СПРУТ» имеет актуальную информацию как о ямах на дороге, так и о погоде, коэффициенте сцепления с дорогой и так далее, которые получает как от дорожных служб и анализа изображений с камер, так и от электронных систем проезжающих автомобилей. Таким образом, «ИТС СПРУТ» в каждый момент времени рассчитывает максимальную безопасную скорость движения. То есть, все ограничения являются динамическими, и соответствуют обстановке в каждом конкретном месте в текущее время. Причём специальные знаки для этого не нужны, вся информация передаётся на индивидуальные светофоры водителей. А все эти уродующие облик городов знаки (что большие, что маленькие) вообще не нужны. <br><br> Вывод: описанная реализация принципа «защита от дурака» теоретически позволяет гарантировать 100% безопасность дорожного движения с точностью до технической неисправности. Но, как говорил Эйнштейн: «Эксперимент это единственный судья научной истины». Поэтому, докажем экспериментально, что в системе «ИТС СПРУТ» ДТП невозможны в принципе, с точностью до технической неисправности. Для этого построим масштабную модель системы «ИТС СПРУТ» состоящую из двух вэб-камер, обеспечивающих вид сверху, и двух радиоуправляемых машинок, управление которыми выведено на компьютер. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8b/fc/u0/8bfcu0mqwbu44shcnr8oq_ovhe4.jpeg"></a> <br><br> Для доказательства смоделируем все причины ДТП и экспериментально докажем, что ни по одной из них в предлагаемой системе ДТП произойти не может. Полностью видео моделирования представлены в первом видео на сайте проекта ekologurban.livejournal.com. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pFr2A7G2ttw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br> Здесь же рассмотрим общие принципы на нескольких примерах. <br><br> На экране программы в реальном времени отображаются: вверху слева – видео с камеры системы «ИТС СПРУТ», справа – схема вида сверху участка дороги, внизу справа – графики скорости автомобилей, слева – элементы управления. Так как для системы безопасности главное это надёжность, то задачу будем решать самым простым, надёжным и понятным графическим способом. На плане вида сверху рисуем все объекты дороги и всех участников дорожного движения плюс их зоны безопасности (участки дороги, где они могут оказаться при действии текущих органов управления за время, необходимое для экстренного торможения). Таким образом, если зона безопасности автомобиля пересечётся с любым препятствием, то применив экстренное торможение через ИС, мы гарантированно успеем затормозить без столкновения с препятствием. В расширенном варианте добавляется ещё зона предупреждения, сигнализирующая о потенциальной опасности. Её размер зависит от заданного времени реакции водителя. При этом, объекты могут быть как реальные, так и виртуальные, например, красный сигнал светофора, виртуальная дорожная разметка, виртуальный пешеходный переход, дорожные работы и так далее. В любом случае, столкнуться с ними невозможно. Таким образом, пока верна евклидова геометрия, ДТП невозможны даже теоретически с точностью до технической неисправности. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ql/ha/4l/qlha4lwxbpsevrba--f2fhxscjm.jpeg"></a> <br><br> Докажем невозможность превышения скорости: для этого достаточно при превышении скорости блокировать дальнейший разгон, а при снижении, разрешать. Следовательно, даже при постоянном «газ в пол» автомобиль будет ехать рывками, но не превышая заданную скорость. Причём ограничения скорости являются контекстными и зависят от конкретного места и времени (например, только днём перед школами); а также индивидуальными в зависимости от квалификации водителя, шипованной резины и так далее. Таким образом, все искусственные ухудшения дорожной инфраструктуры Vision Zero (лежачие полицейские, меры «успокоения» трафика и так далее) становятся, БЕССМЫСЛЕННЫМИ с точки зрения безопасности! <br><br><h3> Пример моделирования невозможности «выезда на встречку» </h3><br> На самом деле, выезд на встречную полосу напрямую не является причиной ДТП. Причина в неправильном расчёте этого манёвра и в несогласованных действиях его участников. Рассмотрим дорогу с двухсторонним движением по одной полосе в каждую сторону. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pv/qy/ne/pvqyneduuoz_n4mthlloars-zg4.jpeg"></a> <br><br> В обычном состоянии обе полосы разделены непреодолимым виртуальным барьером (сплошная линия). Пусть на одной из полос стоит чёрный автомобиль, а сзади к нему приближается красный. Во-первых, «ИТС СПРУТ» постоянно следит за соблюдением дистанции, то есть при опасном приближении к переднему автомобилю дистанционно включает тормоза. Далее, объехать чёрный автомобиль через сплошную линию невозможно, поэтому по запросу красного «ИТС СПРУТ» временно создаёт виртуальный участок двухполосной дороги с односторонним движением (на рисунке выше). А после завершения «обгона», этот участок, опять же виртуально ликвидируется, и выехать на встречную полосу опять невозможно. Таким образом, потенциально опасный обгон с выездом на встречную полосу, всегда заменяется опережением без выезда на встречную полосу. <br><br><h3> Аналогично моделируются и все остальные причины ДТП </h3><br> Таким образом, мы экспериментально доказали снижение количества погибших в ДТП практически до нуля, с точностью до технической неисправности транспорта. Но при наличии системы «ИТС СПРУТ», большинство технических неисправностей тоже не приведут к ДТП. Так как, выявив неисправный автомобиль на ранней стадии, «ИТС СПРУТ» создаёт ему свободный коридор, посылая соответствующие команды окружающим его автомобилям. Поэтому, в большинстве случаев, неисправный автомобиль не столкнётся с другими и безопасно остановится, не причинив серьёзного ущерба. Более того, принципиально неправильно рассматривать последствия технических неисправностей как ДТП, правильнее рассматривать их как техногенные катастрофы. <br><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br> Хорошо известно, что любую проблему эффективнее всего предупредить, а не бороться с её последствиями. При существующем хаотическом дорожном движении ничего гарантировать невозможно в принципе (сейчас руль вправо и Вы въезжаете в автобусную остановку, и ни что этому помешать не может). Более того, ежегодно в мире 1 миллион 350 тысяч человек погибает даже не в случайных ДТП, а в ДТП, все участники которых до самого последнего момента всеми силами и средствами пытались этих ДТП избежать, но не смогли. Но как было экспериментально доказано выше, концепция «защита от дурака» системы «ИТС СПРУТ» может гарантировать безопасность, не допуская даже преднамеренных ДТП. При этом, дополнительных денег на систему «ИТС СПРУТ» не нужно! Просто деньги собранные по ОСАГО+КАСКО надо тратить не на похороны людей и автомобилей как сейчас, а на то, чтобы ДТП вообще не было. <br><br> PS: так как все возможности «ИТС СПРУТ» доказаны экспериментально, то заявления в духе «Это невозможно, потому, что невозможно никогда» не имеют смысла. Соответственно, если какие-то ваши красивые и выгодные теории «плоской Земли» не соответствуют реальности, то ничего не поделаешь, придётся менять эти устаревшие теории. Обратите внимание, что хотя «всяк знает, что 100% не бывает, а железо в воде тонет», корабли из железа прекрасно плавают, это и называется инновациями. Говоря о 100% я намеренно пытаюсь упростить экспертам задачу, так как для доказательства НЕ 100% достаточно привести всего ОДИН контр пример. Но за девять лет, и более двадцати «экспертиз», ни одного такого примера представлено так и не было. <br><br> Продолжение следует … </cut></div>
