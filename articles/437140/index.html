This is a very simple, fast and fun game, which I consider to be one of the best board games in general. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  The game includes 55 cards with 8 different symbols on each.  Here‚Äôs what these cards look like: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5v/7y/np/5v7ynp8kareaswkulm_hxohwh3c.png"></p><br><p>  <em>Fig.</em>  <em>1.</em> An example of the game cards. </p><br><p>  For every two cards there is one and only one character.  In the above figure, this is a pencil symbol: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ci/nf/sk/cinfskolooccs4yyfon4giaequ4.png"></p><br><p>  <em>Fig.</em>  <em>2.</em> Matching characters on the cards. </p><br><p>  The player who first saw the match makes an action with one of the cards, depending on the round of the game.  For example, he takes it to himself or throws up his opponent. <br>  Often this leads to the fact that one of the cards for which players are looking for matches, is changing.  Because of this, one has to look for a new coincidence, which may be a completely different symbol: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/c3/lf/nx/c3lfnx9zi8gc0vxdmwrwwnykfay.png"></p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zs/my/kn/zsmykneeuuwdzvhbygccg-9_kuy.png"></p><br><p>  <em>Fig.</em>  <em>3, 4.</em> The first card is replaced with a new one.  Now between them is a new coincidence - the symbol of the clown. </p><br><h2 id="kak-oni-eto-delayut">  How do they do it? </h2><br><p>  At first glance, it seems incredible that there is exactly one match on two cards, no more, no less.  Immediately questions arise - how many characters are there in the game?  There cannot be too few of them (then there will be more than one coincidence on the cards) or too many (then there may be no coincidence on the cards at all). <br>  In addition, it is obvious that the symbols are arranged on the cards in a special order, which guarantees the only match for any two cards. </p><br><p>  Elementary Google skills lead us to stackoverflow, which describes why this happens: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6240113/what-are-the-mathematical-computational-principles-behind-this-game">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6240113/what-are-the-mathematical-computational-principles-behind-this-game</a> </p><br><p>  The game uses the principles of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">finite geometry</a> .  Although this phrase has the word "geometry", this concept refers more to combinatorics than to geometry.  It operates with a finite number of points, which can be located, in particular, in the form of a <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C">projective plane</a> . </p><br><p>  Cards and symbols in the game are elements of the projective plane of the 7th order.  This means that on each card <strong>n + 1</strong> symbol, and the total number of unique symbols in the game is <strong>n ^ 2 + n + 1</strong> , i.e.  57 characters. </p><br><p>  There are planes of both lower and higher orders.  For example, there is a 5 order plane.  For it, there are 6 symbols on the card, and the total number of unique symbols in the game is 5 ^ 2 + 5 + 1 = 31. The projective plane of this configuration is used in a simpler version of the Dobl game called <a href="http://www.igroved.ru/games/dobble-1-2-3/">Dobl 1,2,3</a> . </p><br><p>  The relationship between points and lines for a projective plane is defined using <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8">an incidence matrix</a> .  Its appearance is presented in the section ‚ÄúThe Incidence Matrix for the Dobbl Game‚Äù. </p><br><h2 id="konechnaya-geometriya-dlya-grudnichkov">  Ultimate geometry for babies </h2><br><p>  <em>Much later, after writing the <a href="https://github.com/Skybladev2/DobbleMathModel">original article,</a> I attended a lecture by <a href="https://savvateev.xyz/">Alexey Savvateev</a> , where he spoke about projective geometry much shorter and clearer.</em>  <em>But since I do not have the strength or desire to rewrite half of the article because of this, I simply recommend his book "Mathematics for the Humanities" if my attempt by the savage to explain the structure of the car on the fingers is incomprehensible or boring.</em> </p><br><p>  First, let's go to Wikipedia and read several articles.  The first article describes the concept of finite geometry: </p><br><blockquote>  <strong>Finite geometry</strong> is any geometric system that has a <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE">finite</a> number of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25BE%25D1%2587%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0_%2528%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F%2529">points</a> .  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">[one]</a> </blockquote><p>  So far, everything is simple.  If a pen on paper draws a few points, then they will already make up some final geometry. <br>  Further surprise awaits many: </p><br><blockquote> For example, the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2595%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">Euclidean geometry is</a> not finite, since the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D1%258F%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F">Euclidean straight line</a> contains an unlimited number of points, more precisely, it contains exactly as many points as there are <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25B5%25D1%2589%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2587%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE">real numbers</a> .  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">[one]</a> </blockquote><p>  For us, this means that the piece of paper on which our points are drawn <strong>is not a plane in terms of final geometry</strong> .  It is just a carrier of points. </p><br><blockquote>  There are two types of geometry on the plane: <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D1%2584%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">affine</a> and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">projective</a> .  In affine geometry, the usual notion of parallelism of straight lines is used.  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">[one]</a> </blockquote><p>  Recall the axioms of affine geometry: </p><br><blockquote>  Affine geometry on a plane is a non-empty set <em><strong>X</strong></em> (whose elements are called "points"), with a non-empty set <em><strong>L of</strong></em> subsets of <em><strong>X</strong></em> (whose elements are called "straight line"), such that: <br><br><ol><li>  For two different points, there is only one straight line that contains both points. </li><li>  For a line <em><strong>‚Ñì</strong></em> and a point <em><strong>p</strong></em> that does not belong to —Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤—É–µ—Ç, there is one and only one straight line <em><strong>‚Ä≤ ‚Ä≤</strong></em> containing <em><strong>p</strong></em> such that <em><strong>‚Ñì</strong></em> ‚à© <em><strong>‚Ñì ‚Ä≤</strong></em> = ‚àÖ. </li><li>  There are many of four points, no three of which lie on one straight line.  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">[one]</a> </li></ol><br></blockquote><p>  These axioms enable us to understand what the simplest affine plane looks like in finite geometry: </p><br><blockquote>  The simplest affine plane contains only 4 points, and is called a <em>second-order affine plane</em> .  Each pair of points defines a unique straight line, therefore the indicated plane contains 6 straight lines.  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">[one]</a> </blockquote><p>  Not very clear?  That's right.  If you look at the definition of affine geometry, then you can see that it operates with the concepts of set theory (element, set, subset). <br>  This means that straight lines may not look like the usual straight lines of Euclidean geometry. </p><br><p>  In fact, it is.  If you look at the drawing of the second-order affine plane, we will see the following picture: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8be/166/f48/8be166f484185ff1aa7b12f310063fb3.png" alt="Order 2 affine plane"></p><br><p>  <em>Fig.</em>  <em>5.

Straight lines of the same color are considered parallel. </p><br><p>  It is easy to see that the lines here are not of infinite length.  In secret I will say that the concept of length is not here at all, and straight lines can have any shape, as we will soon see. </p><br><p>  Surely,% username% still doubts that the image of this plane satisfies the axioms of affine geometry.  Let's check: </p><br><ol><li>  We take 2 any points, for example, the left upper and left lower. <br>  Both of these points contain only one left red line. <br>  The right red line does not contain any of these points, and the other straight lines contain only one of them. </li><li>  Take the left red line and the right upper point.  Obviously, only one straight (right red) is parallel to the left red straight line, since it passes through the upper right point, but does not pass through any of the two left points. </li><li>  The figure clearly shows that no matter what 3 points we take, one of them lies on a line that is different from the line on which <strong>both</strong> other points lie. <br>  The two straight lines that make up the diagonal of a square do not intersect, since they have no common points. </li></ol><br><p>  If you understand the content of the previous picture, then the picture is more complicated: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9db/f9f/c0d/9dbf9fc0d4f383a05eecbd28d4fdd0cb.png" alt="Order 3 affine plane"></p><br><p>  <em>Fig.</em>  <em>6. The</em> affine plane of the third order.

Yes,% username%, these ellipses are actually straight lines in terms of finite geometry. <br>  The figures of the same color are parallel straight lines.  They are difficult to notice, so we divide the image into several: </p><br><table><thead><tr><th>  Plane number 1 </th><th>  Plane number 2 </th><th>  Plane number 3 </th><th>  Plane number 4 </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sh/sg/cc/shsgccz1-nfb4xn7xpvazl20wbs.png"></td><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qz/p1/rl/qzp1rlf13vh1iq-tw8zgrobhz28.png"></td><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hd/ki/po/hdkipo0qhxlkyytxtool7wzmfzq.png"></td><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_r/pv/ze/_rpvzep5-elabo_ll0nlp0mbmdy.png"></td></tr></tbody></table><br><p>  <em>Fig.</em>  <em>7.</em> Parallel straight lines of the third order affine plane. </p><br><p>  Here, checking the fulfillment of axioms will take a little more time: </p><br><ol><li>  We take 2 any points, for example, the upper center and lower right.  Only one of the purple lines passes through them. </li><li>  Take the left red line and the right lower point.  Similar to the plane of the second order, only one right red line passes through this point, but does not pass through any of the three left points. </li><li>  Here is a little more complicated than in the case of a 2-order plane.  The formulation of the axiom says that you need to find at least one (non-empty) set of four points in which no three lie on more than one line. <br>  Obviously, 12 sets with three points through which the lines in the figure pass do not satisfy this condition.  But he is satisfied, for example, with a set of four corner points. </li></ol><br><blockquote>  In the more general case, a finite affine plane of order <em><strong>n</strong></em> has <em><strong>n ^ 2</strong></em> points and <em><strong>n ^ 2 + n</strong></em> lines;  each line contains <em><strong>n</strong></em> points, and each point belongs to <em><strong>n + 1</strong></em> lines.  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">[one]</a> </blockquote><p>  We finished with affine geometry, go to the second type of geometry on the plane - projective. </p><br><blockquote>  In projective geometry, on the contrary, any two straight lines intersect at the only possible point, and therefore there are no parallel straight lines.  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">[one]</a> </blockquote><p>  The previous sentence describes the second axiom of projective geometry.
