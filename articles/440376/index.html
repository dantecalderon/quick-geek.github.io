Players travel around Box Island and help the character collect stars scattered across the desert.  Through the game quest, children learn the basics of algorithms, sequences, cycles, and conditional expressions, and the game develops algorithmic thinking and pattern recognition. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>CodeKarts</b> is an application for preparing preschoolers to learn coding.  The puzzle develops observation, concentration and logic.  The game takes place on the track: the children write the code and make up the path for the racing car.  The game is available in two modes: with one car without time limits or competition with the application CodeKarts. <br><br><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/yGV0HVjHL6tNsrCkOWj1-spt4QLa49jLfiWZ7UeYtjnQYhoaKyXAyA7E_d7vM_0owTH4IBZf9PsqxbzWffrS8Yhevsp7WeXYK0Fk9axM6sd3ZYo68U0eDzVLQ_wvC5SmCB-PqAVs" alt="image"><br>  <i>CodeKarts Games</i> <br><br>  <b>ScratchJr</b> is an introductory programming language for children that helps you create your own interactive stories and games.  Children revive characters to move, jump, dance and sing.  Children will learn to solve problem situations, develop projects and creatively express their thoughts using technology. <br><br>  <b>ElChavo</b> is a free game whose developers urge parents to study with their children, because in the 21st century, programming should become as essential a subject as writing or reading.  Through the game, the child will learn how to program instructions for the character and control the object in three-dimensional space, and he also earns points and medals. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8X7EWn0IYWM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><blockquote>  <i><b>Konstantin Zhuchkov, teacher of the course ‚ÄúProgramming for the smallest‚Äù</b></i> <br><br><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/8JuCuNhX4Z3vbkAzuEV2l_2Szp--S8Eck9DLTZ9gAb1IFcxiIpzyQv8mxIP4jDInAuKXRCcU6DGlapt4Vpq2mBdOhTgkW6rEDmYR6Ti-" width="150" height="150" alt="image" align="left">  <i>FixThe Factory - an obstacle puzzle game from LEGO.</i>  <i>Children run the EV3RSTORM robot, which places the batteries in the factory in the right places.</i>  <i>The game develops logical and spatial thinking, teaches basic operations.</i>  <i>I advise the game FixTheFactory, because it has a beautiful design and clear tasks.</i>  <i>Children solve puzzles as if nuts click.</i>  <i>And most of all children are amazed that in their 4-5 they are already programming.</i> </blockquote>  <b>SpriteBox</b> is a full-scale adventure game that helps you quickly move to coding in a real programming language.  Learning begins with the management of icons, which are then inferior to text commands.  Children solve puzzles and learn sequences, operations, cycles as well. <br><br>  <b>Lightbot</b> is a mobile application from the creators of SpriteBox, which teaches programming with simple puzzles.  The child writes the code and commands the robot, which can walk, turn, jump and turn on the light. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VLl0gIygHx8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>PictoMir</b> is a Russian development for teaching children the basics of programming.  In Piktomir, the child collects a simple program of icons and controls the robot.  The game is aimed at preschoolers, so writing code is not required. <br><br><h2>  For schoolchildren </h2><br>  <b>Scratch</b> is a popular programming game for teaching children from 8 to 16 years old.  It is suitable for the study of algorithms, data and variables, the development of basic concepts.  The game is simple, clear and leads to quick results - the child creates cartoons, animation, mini-games with the help of new skills.  Scratch teaches not only programming, but also design.  To get started, just watch the instructional video or read the book ‚ÄúScratch for Kids‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Minecraft</b> is the favorite game of children around the world.  She inspired Microsoft to create an educational program based on it.  The child chooses a hero and writes code to interact with the character.  In the process, he learns basic programming concepts and learns to use commands to control the movements of heroes in the game world.  In Sweden, Minecraft is included in the school curriculum as a tool for the development of digital creativity.  Better to understand programming with Minecraft, you can use the book by Craig Richardson. <br><blockquote>  <i><b>Alexander Tsegenko, teaches the course "Programming Minecraft"</b></i> <br><br><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/KmFUeH68CV-LsSWB0SranzHTjaCy9Wqx21LPbcrsepxTKT3yWTsTB9p4DCDKdCIU7lt4JuL8hvjvp_UvLs7AlB6lLp3pHCMGHp2kzeAfWTrqoq12txh-aGby7iadIfToEQ56EpPr" width="250" height="250" alt="image" align="left">  <i>Minecraft develops the child's imagination.</i>  <i>It helps children to understand what materials the tools are made of and in general our whole world.</i>  <i>Due to the division of the game world into cubes, children develop spatial imagination.</i>  <i>Also, children learn to protect nature, because the game has real cause-and-effect relationships.</i>  <i>If a fire starts, the forest can completely burn out.</i>  <i>If you destroy the class of animals, they will cease to appear.</i> </blockquote>  <b>CodeMonkey</b> is a fun and informative game in which children learn to program in real language.
