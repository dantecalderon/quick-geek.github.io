Rooster "Yuytu-2" will be activated on February 28, the equipment of the module "Chang'e-4" will begin to wake up on March 1, 2019. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Previously published materials about "Chang'e-4":</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/435032/">1.

Basically, these are informational messages that all systems are working normally. <br><br>  It is clear that now on Earth and the Moon research work is in full swing, and time is very valuable on a lunar day, complex processes are underway to manage the modules and conduct various studies using analyzers, spectrometers and detectors. <br><br>  Obtaining and analyzing data also takes a lot of time, especially since this is already very valuable scientific information that needs to be checked and carried out additional research, sometimes even sprinkling them into the current schedule of lunar modules. <br><br>  During the second lunar day, on the module Chang'e-4, measurements were taken and data was obtained from the instruments: <br><br>  - lunar neutron and radiation dose detector (LND, Germany); <br>  - neutral atomic detector (ASAN, Sweden); <br>  - Visible and Near-Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (VNIS). <br><br>  All instruments onboard the Chang'e-4 module operate smoothly and according to the planned algorithms. <br><br>  The Chinese Internet portal “System of publications and collection of scientific data and studies of lunar and deep space” also earned, which will publish and process the received data and images from Chang'e-4 (and there are already gigabytes of data from earlier missions) . <br><br>  → <a href="http://202.106.152.98:8081/moondata/">Path to the portal</a> <br><br>  The first night on the far side of the Moon was, according to the sensors of the Chang'e-4 modules, very cold, the temperature on the lunar surface dropped (minimum) to minus 190 degrees Celsius.  We will wait for data on the temperature in the second moon night. <br><br>  By the way, for the power supply of the “Chang'e-4” modules during the moonlit night, the thermal units developed at the Russian Federal Nuclear Center (VNII Experimental Physics (VNIIEF)) are also radiation sources of heat (RHS) and radioisotope sources of electricity (RTG), intended to power systems of the Chinese lunar mission. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gc/-v/aj/gc-vajnhxgd-wka3ctefo3ukn3o.gif"><br><br>  Using a radioisotope thermoelectric generator, the equipment of the Chang'e-4 landing module during the lunar night can operate at a low level of activity and carry out measurements of the soil temperature. <br><br>  Rover "Yuytu-2" also folds its solar panels and goes into sleep mode, going to the scheme of heating its elements from a radiation source of heat. <br><br>  Six-wheeled Rover "Yuytu-2": <br><br>  - The total mass of the rover is about 140 kg (310 pounds); <br>  - load capacity - about 20 kg (44 pounds); <br>  - can move on slopes and has automatic sensors that prevent collisions with other objects; <br>  - electric power rover is provided with two solar panels, allowing the rover to work during the lunar day, as well as charge its batteries; <br>  - The maximum speed of 200 meters per hour (this speed on the Moon will not be reached anyway - as the elements on the surface will not allow acceleration and will destroy the rover earlier); <br>  - The maximum study area - 3 square meters.  km; <br>  - estimated time of work - 3 months; <br>  - The maximum distance is 10 km. <br><br>  Since the lunar surface in the Chang'e-4 landing zone abounds in folds, numerous pebbles and small craters, after each small movement of a few tens of centimeters is completed, the rover should stop, take a picture of the surface around and send this data back to Earth via satellite repeater. <br><br>  The data is then processed and a further route is outlined along which the rover will follow. <br><br>  As you can see, the “Yuuta-2” rover moves across the surface of the moon, carefully avoiding obstacles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9c7/3cf/7b7/9c73cf7b7fe91393ff0f96e37e00f987.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Antennas of the Yuytu-2 rover must be configured to point at the satellite repeater in order to send and receive control signals correctly, while the rover’s solar panels must be optimally tilted to get a lot of sunlight in order to maximize electricity at the time of the transfer of data. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/986/3e3/901/9863e39013136f63bd14ae2c5c94af9e.gif"><br><br>  On the second lunar day on the back of the Moon, the Root Yuyu-2 had already traveled a total distance of over 120 meters, breaking the record of its predecessor, the Root Yuyu of the Chang'e-3 mission, which was technically immobilized on January 25, 2014 ( the result of the collision) after overcoming 114.8 meters on a complex lunar surface. <br><br>  Here is the current table of data on the distances traveled by lunar rovers and rovers, so far only one device has overcome the distance of the Olympic marathon - <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/440250/">Opportunity</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cz/uu/w2/czuuw29j2hqqefohhfykmhzlpp0.jpeg"><br><br>  Several photos of the lunar surface: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wj/th/nk/wjthnkx-yz2li4evvqupvfrrava.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wy/em/eu/wyemeu7ybwkymndy0ltmngdbjec.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uy/zu/2k/uyzu2kdrnnk6cliokosscpeickc.jpeg"></div>
