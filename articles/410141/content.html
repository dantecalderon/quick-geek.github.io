<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  Almost simultaneously with the release of the 5000 series of projectors, which we will talk about very soon, <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/projectors/epson-eh-tw610/">Epson EH-TW610</a> and <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/projectors/epson-eh-tw650/">Epson EH-TW650</a> projectors appeared in the Epson product <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/projectors/epson-eh-tw650/">line</a> , which <i>once again</i> lowered the price bar for home full HD devices. </p><br><p>  How exactly reduced?  Judge for yourself: </p><br><ul><li>  Epson EH-TW610 - $ 820 </li><li>  Epson EH-TW650 - $ 880 <i>(will be sold in major federal networks)</i> </li></ul><br><p>  This is how it is.  Now, Epson's <i>most low-end full HD</i> home cinema <i>projectors</i> are not “five thousandths,” but <b>“six-hundredths</b> . <b>”</b> </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gx/tn/7q/gxtn7qfpy8238izldy0-7skvoa0.jpeg"></div><br><p>  Models Epson EH-TW610 and Epson EH-TW650 are almost identical, but in terms of characteristics they are analogs of the already well-known Epson EH-TW5200, but without 3D support ( <i>for, <b>suddenly</b> , it turned out that 3D is absolutely not needed by the overwhelming majority of projector buyers )</i> . </p><br><p>  Next - a few words about how they are still good. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  They shorter focus </h2><br><p>  These projectors are very convenient for desktop installation on a temporary basis due to <i>shorter-focus</i> optics than Epson EH-TW5400.  An image with a diagonal of 100 inches (width 221 cm) it projects from a distance of 227 cm (the <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/calc-general/">calculator is here</a> ). </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mf/ht/uq/mfhtuqpmsy2jrq5k0rcwvbobcvw.png"></div><br><p>  Fast keystone correction (automatic vertical and a special slider horizontally) allows you to almost instantly set the projector to the left / right and above / below the optimal position relative to the screen. </p><br><p>  Compared to the same Epson EH-TW5400, both the new Epson EH-TW610 and Epson EH-TW650 are more <i>versatile home projectors</i> and, to a lesser extent, specialized home theater projectors, although many of the settings that “make” of universal projector home and vice versa - that still "taste".  A clear distinction between these niches is difficult and fraught with heated debates of experts of all stripes. </p><br><p>  These models have a built-in Wi-Fi projection function, but it is similar to that used by office projectors and is not suitable for transmitting high definition video. </p><br><h2>  They are brighter </h2><br><p>  Yes, oddly enough, despite the lower price, new projectors are half brighter than the same Epson EH-TW5200: 3000 vs. 2000 lumens.  What does this give?  It is clear - more versatility compared to the "traditional" projector for DC, because the brightness of 3000 lm is enough to project even in a well-lit room.  It can be both a living room and a home cinema itself, but with the lights on, when, for example, you want to watch a sports program, stream on a tweet or play something colorful and bright, such as Horizon: Zero Dawn or Rachet &amp; Clank, eg. </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/b5/h4/ln/b5h4lncqufhsjvwtuabav9ytkos.gif"></div><br><p>  These projectors are out of competition in terms of brightness among the "lamp" (3000 lumens, 210-watt lamp), and thanks to 3LCD technology, <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/epson/blog/222115/">high brightness goes side by side with high-quality color reproduction</a> , and does not degrade it. </p><br><h2>  Are they ... lighter? </h2><br><p>  Hmmm, I did not come up with another title.  Well, okay.  In general, due to the high brightness, the lamp life of the new products is very curious.  To be precise: </p><br><ul><li>  Epson EH-TW5200: Standard mode - 5000 hours, eco mode - 6000 hours </li><li>  Epson EH-TW610 / 650: Standard mode - 4500 hours, <b>eco mode - 7500 hours</b> </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/q2/-h/sx/q2-hsx1mv-gzt-xdaqqq1zxztcc.png" align="right"><p>  It is reasonable that with increasing brightness the standard loop, in which the projector “peels” with a maximum brightness of more than 3000 lm versus 2000 lm for the Epson EH-TW5200, will be a little faster to plant the lamp.  Although not much. </p><br><p>  But with <i>eco-mode is</i> much more interesting. </p><br><p>  When switching to this mode, the projector actually turns into an Epson EH-TW5200, because its brightness decreases ... Just to about 2000 lm! </p><br><p>  Those.  Not only is the new projectors cheaper <i>by themselves</i> , the lamp replacement in them can not be remembered even longer than before with the same brightness that the previous “popular” five thousand meter gave. </p><br><h2>  They are clearer </h2><br><p>  The projectors "six hundred" series has a function to improve the clarity of the image.  This, of course, is not about the standard “sharpness” setting that any TV has, but about the same thing that the most expensive Epson projectors recently boasted of — this function was called “Super Resolution”.  When viewing any content with high details, be it photos, colorful art or movies in 1080p and high bitrate, you can adjust it in the menu “Image Enhancement”, and the picture from the projector will look clearer and more intelligible. </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uc/cp/1y/uccp1yiasznwfp6gnqxzwrgke-q.png"></div><br><p>  This feature is especially useful when viewing images <i>at a higher resolution than full HD</i> on the projector, since when scaling to full HD, their details will be smoothed and slightly blurred (bilinear interpolation is the same).  Of course, tastes do not argue, so this opportunity can be used or not used, but the main thing is that it is available! </p><br><h2>  They are already here </h2><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/z6/4j/xe/z64jxeittlcjsum1-ynelafpaca.png"></div><br><p>  Despite the fact that projectors appeared relatively recently, <a href="https://market.yandex.ru/product/1732953213%3Fshow-uid%3D174686268544383047916020%26nid%3D55009%26glfilter%3D7893318%253A153058%26context%3Dsearch">on J.Market it is</a> already possible to find a lot of offers and buy a device even now. </p><br><h2>  And now what? </h2><br><p>  The output of <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/projectors/epson-eh-tw610/">Epson EH-TW610</a> and <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/projectors/epson-eh-tw650/">Epson EH-TW650</a> once again underlines that Epson realizes that the buyer most often searches for the <i>most versatile projector</i> , which “is a Swiss player, a reaper, and a igrets player”, i.e.  Not only has a high brightness required to work in lit rooms, but it can boast a high resolution, equally important for viewing 1080p content and playing on modern gaming consoles. </p><br><p>  Previously, “universal” projectors in our projectors catalog were larger than either HD-ready <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/proj-general/">projectors</a> or <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/proj-general/">office devices and school projectors</a> with high brightness but not the highest resolution (primarily because of the need to ensure low cost). </p><br><p>  With the release of these new products, you can get, as they say, “the best of both worlds” - a democratic price, high resolution and brightness margin, which is enough to use the projector in a variety of conditions, ranging from a completely darkened home theater and ending with at least a bright office room. </p><br>  PS And since February 19th we have a joint action with ivi.ru - when you buy a home projector, <a href="http://epson.ivi.ru/">you can get 6 months of an ivi + subscription</a> as a gift. </div>
