Next, load the .stl file into the Snapmaker3D slicer and prepare the model for printing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/o2/12/ww/o212wwffmpprevpu6myctic9jym.jpeg"><br><br>  Snapmaker3D does not stand out among the variety of slicers.  This is not Simplify3D, but not Repetier-host, the average functionality of the program. <br><br>  In this slicer, you can move an object in the XY plane, scale and rotate it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vs/5x/xo/vs5xxovblh5947gjg99dxumt8a0.jpeg"><br><br>  The settings for the printing process are standard: the choice of profiles, PLA and ABS, four options for presets, the presence of Brim, Raft, Skirt. <br><br>  In Custom Preset, you can change the values. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3q/4z/if/3q4zif1ujutkbhu5hgf4nmi_p-u.jpeg"><br><br>  Slicer Cons: <br><br>  1. You can load only one object. <br>  2. You can not adjust the position of the object along the Z axis <br><br>  Pros: <br><br>  1. Simple and intuitive interface <br>  2. Output file format - .gcode <br>  3. Ability to work with Simplify3D <br><br>  Video Print: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YUEV2CBxz9U" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Laser</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ua/g2/bi/uag2bivsfhi7fygi0vx0b785xyy.jpeg"><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nEbS7AMShac" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  To prepare Snapmaker for laser engraving, we need to remove the heating table and the FDM head, set the table with the mount for materials and the head with a solid-state laser. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ns/wn/d1/nswnd1mdqo03iqfbpdv6vbnsczg.jpeg"><br><br>  After that, we connect the Snapmaker to the PC, connect via the com port and focus the laser. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qg/i4/yw/qgi4ywrnf_ootvklzhankwniqhc.jpeg"><br><br>  The engraving area is quite small - it is 80x80 mm.  Nominally, it is 125x125, but when using standard clips decreases along the edges.  If you are ready to risk and engrave without fixing the workpiece, you can use the entire area of ​​the platform. <br><br>  Focusing is done manually.  It is necessary to achieve the smallest point. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/y_/zh/z_/y_zhz_ulao5dfoiz7taoye-pcdo.jpeg"><br><br>  You can control the position of the head and height in Snapmakerjs, the module itself also has focus controls. <br><br>  This program has three functional windows: <br><br>  1. Workspace window <br>  2. Picture preparation window <br>  3. Window with program settings. <br><br>  In the workspace window we can control the position of the laser and the focusing power, we can see the display of the commands being executed, set the speed of the passage, set the relative zero. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0n/b7/1s/0nb71ss-5v4ds509ue6ahiebafo.jpeg"><br><br>  In the window with the preparation of the picture, adjust the dimensions of the picture, contrast, brightness, image processing method, display quality.  Here is formed gcode for laser engraving. <br><br>  In this case, we are processing the image in grayscale mode.  The image is raster, from separate points, but not curves. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/b9/-w/pb/b9-wpblwa-7xryukcfi7ptfx9xy.jpeg"><br><br>  After setting the settings, you can see the preview and form the final gcode.  Processing a vector image here is similar to the work of CorelDraw. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yv/k3/sk/yvk3skpmpcvxtdyv2lfu7gb37e8.jpeg"><br><br>  Here we see a black rectangle.  Upon closer examination, it becomes clear that this is the visualization of the path that the laser will follow and burn the image, point by point.  The process is quite long, can not be said about the engraving of vector drawings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kn/cb/_d/kncb_dcxnfchhtwhdounhwf79l8.jpeg"><br><br>  Logos are much faster burned in the mode of black and white engraving, through the vector.  But in a raster format, a much more interesting result is obtained. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xt/yx/z7/xtyxz7huovloaf7slt9t2zj1q1k.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fx/yb/0o/fxyb0o8wvqkd5hfupskypd1npvu.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Milling</b> <br><br>  To prepare for milling, to create 3D models and generate control programs of the standard gcode format, you will need the free Fusion 360 program, then the Snapmakerjs program to broadcast gcode to the machine itself. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sCcvn_FF0-A" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  For the first milling, no special knowledge is required, except for a minimum knowledge of English - the whole process is described in detail, step by step, in the <a href="https://manual.snapmaker.com/cnc_carving/generate_g-code_using_fusion_360.html">instructions</a> . <br><br>  To begin with, we are offered a simple example - cut out the Latin letter S. To do this, we need to open the Fusion 360, create the outline of the letter and “extrude” it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/za/xd/qt/zaxdqtkzqjankm9le94icdl6onu.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vi/vb/qb/vivbqbk5fiqbnjcagive7x-cy5w.jpeg"><br><br>  Then, using the CAM tab, we create the path of the cutter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pj/d3/0y/pjd30yyfrqgnp8ct3yauevqqun8.jpeg"><br><br>  After that, gcode is saved and transferred to Snapmakerjs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pw/rx/b7/pwrxb79zogb76e_btqyptj5mfem.jpeg"><br><br>  We start milling and watch the process. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/el/oc/-4/eloc-4wzchzzbvanefjdbmmsrho.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jy/m0/fu/jym0funurhuwvbtla2spsk62j2u.jpeg"><br><br>  Then you can experiment and make something more complicated. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3i/r_/v-/3ir_v-yzh9xwkiwxxwlegtuq8q8.jpeg"><br><br>  The nuance about the milling area - nominally it is 90x90 mm and 50 mm in depth, but when using clamps the area is reduced to 80x80.  Ie, in fact it turns out 80x80x50 mm. <br><br>  <b>Advantages and disadvantages</b> <br><br>  Pros: <br><br><ul><li>  compactness </li><li>  mobility, </li><li>  easy handling, </li><li>  quality, </li><li>  appearance. </li></ul><br>  Minuses: <br><br><ul><li>  small work area </li><li>  low spindle power </li><li>  large reach cutters </li><li>  insufficient rigidity for serious milling. </li></ul><br>  Because of all this, milling is extremely slow.  This machine is still designed for engraving, and not for serious milling. <br><br>  In order to discourage the working zero, in any case, you will have to connect the device to the computer.  Then you can run the control program from a flash drive. <br><br>  There is no feed adjustment in the process; you can only adjust it before running the control program and only from a computer. <br><br>  Good for engraving small printed circuit boards for home-made electronics. <br><br>  <b>Impression, comparison</b> <br><br>  Compare with <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/hi-tech-workshop-skyone.html">SkyOne</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uo/za/jj/uozajjmdedyfqnkxhbnmdd56tlk.jpeg"><br><br>  What is the difference: <br><br>  1. Scara movement mechanics in SkyOne, against the Cartesian system on Snapmaker.  The unevenness of the movement of the mechanics of Scara will affect the resolution during laser and milling engraving.  The Cartesian system has no such problems. <br>  3. Both printers do not have sufficient rigidity for 2.5D milling. <br>  4. The construction area for Snapmaker is 125x125x125 mm, and for SkyOne — 140x190x200 mm. <br>  5. On the other hand, Snapmaker has a layer thickness of 50 microns, which is exactly two times thinner, which will give a smoother surface to an FDM print. <br>  5. More convenient software from Snapmaker. <br><br>  <b>Answers to questions on past reviews</b> <br><br>  <i>- I wonder what the moving parts?</i> <br><br>  If we partially disassemble one of the linear modules, we find a fairly simple system on four rollers of light plastic.  We did not do chemical analysis, but most likely it is nylon or fluoroplastic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dg/hl/qo/dghlqo9xoxmqwt32xvvpcmmn7sg.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/e_/1p/lx/e_1plxkophj_axck5uxbxvoi67a.jpeg"><br><br>  The solution is quite budget and simple.  However, it should be noted the high quality and accuracy of the execution of the milled elements of the housing, as well as the assembly inside the modules.  The rollers do not hang out and provide sufficient rigidity to work all three types of nozzles. <br><br>  <i>- I did not notice any table calibration options.</i>  <i>Sensor Z, I also do not see.</i>  <i>They hope that such brutal beams will allow them to set zero once at the factory and that's all?</i>  <i>Well, good luck, they will need it.</i> <br><br>  Calibration is carried out on four points of the platform.  In the program you need to adjust the clamp on each of the 4 points in sequence.  Thus, by introducing software correction of the distance between the nozzle and the platform, Snapmaker completely eliminated the need for adjusting screws. <br><br>  <i>- How is the rigidity of the structure ensured?</i> <br><br>  For an FDM and a laser, with such small processing areas and print volumes, stiffness plays a small role.  Milling on Snapmaker is relevant for educational and entertainment purposes, it is unlikely that anyone would think to create a prototype of a serious industrial device on it. <br>  Power is small, the rigidity is appropriate. <br><br>  <i>- What is responsible for the accuracy of positioning?</i> <br><br>  There is no ballscrew.  Standard screw drive with tension spring.  It is unlikely that someone confuses in our time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/aj/c6/ed/ajc6edfoatllf9zlna1li2g7uug.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Results, conclusions</b> <br><br>  Snapmaker is not an industrial machine.  This is not the 3D printer, mill or laser cutter that will produce tons of 24/7 products. <br><br>  If you need a machine or printer for commercial use, this is definitely not your choice. <br><br>  This is a miniature desktop machine for learning, entertainment and creating unique do-it-yourself gifts.  With it, you will teach your child the initial skills of working with modern technology, and with three types of machines at the same time.  And you can please with such an original and useful gift and adult.  Few people will leave him indifferent. <br><br>  Although Snapmaker does not have precise accuracy, rigidity, volumes of the working area - it has a different purpose, and it performs it.  With his goals, he copes perfectly.  And besides, it looks very good. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sy/ii/wi/syiiwiapuc2gwlqy33ryrs3csmy.jpeg"><br><br>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/mfu-snapmaker.html">Buy</a> Snapmaker and get free training you can in the Top 3D Shop.
