<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello everyone again!  Today we have a short story about which smart pens you can choose as a gift for February 23.  Anyway, the pen is the same accessory that comes to mind when you need to choose a gift for a man. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/g8/p3/ae/g8p3aeaapkb_zajmxvz2c7pqmr8.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Surprisingly, we found that the smart pen niche came to life and even included major luxury brands.  Let's start with them. <br><br><h4>  Montblanc </h4><br>  Montblanc's clever writing accessories are designed with Wacom technology: the kit includes the Montblanc pen itself, a branded leather case, which is already expensive.  The lowest price for pens of this brand is from 17,000 rubles. <br><br>  A tablet is built into the case, which recognizes everything you are writing on top of, and then sends the data to the proprietary application.  Pen and paper are the most common here, but the cost is currently <a href="http://www.montblanc.com/ru-ru/discover/specials/augmented-paper.html">from 45,900 rubles</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kl/rl/3x/klrl3xx9zd3-o0w-htl0brju0cg.jpeg"><br><br>  A similar idea has already been implemented by Wacom itself, and was also (not very successfully) replicated on crowdfunding sites - something very similar called <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/278326629/idnbook-smart-writing-notebook">IDNBook ended a</a> few hours ago on Kickstarter. <br><br><h4>  Moleskine </h4><br>  Prestigious diaries have got a special marking under the smart pen N2: the companies united in one of the joint projects. <br><br>  The kit is available now in Russia at a price of <a href="https://market.yandex.ru/search%3Fcvredirect%3D2%26text%3DSmart%2520Writing%2520Moleskine%26local-offers-first%3D0%26deliveryincluded%3D0%26onstock%3D0">about 18 thousand rubles</a> .  The pen that comes with the kit recognizes what is written with the help of special markings on sheets and transfers the data to the smartphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/07/ou/gm/07ougm2ghtku4u57jbon6jf6dcc.jpeg"><br><br>  For work, you need special notebooks. <br><br><h4>  Neo SmartPen N2 </h4><br>  Actually, the handle from the previous paragraph, which <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/neo-smartpen-n2.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dn2%26utm_campaign%3Dn2">is sold under its own brand</a> .  The South Korean company NeoLab once made a general revolution in its category, removing the extra element that used to be equipped with such gadgets - an additional scanner-receiver of data. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xc/mk/a8/xcmka8shtab7vbetjhcqky1pi40.jpeg"><br><br>  Now this scanner is built into the body of the pen because of what it received such a shape, slightly resembling a classic pen.  The scanner detects data by NCode markup, saves data to the smartphone or internal memory. <br><br>  Compact size and light weight is not much different from its usual writing accessories.  Success for a small South Korean crowdfunding brand drew attention to the handle and large companies, including the aforementioned Moleskine. <br><br><h4>  HP Pro Slate </h4><br>  Currently, <a href="https://market.yandex.ru/product--hp-pro-slate-12-tablet/12558969">it is not easy to</a> find a set of multi-functional pen and tablet.  The pen itself could be used both as a stylus and as a scanner of records, however, as noted in the reviews, for proper operation it was necessary to comply with a sufficient number of conditions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ej/aa/_t/ejaa_thkg90ssw4sdjdtolzf1ng.jpeg"><br><br>  The only plus was the presence of a tablet. <br><br><blockquote>  As can be estimated from this small selection, the category of smart pens developed in three directions: pen + tablet, pen with integrated scanner, requiring ( <i>or not requiring *</i> ) an additional accessory - a notebook, and pens that worked in tandem with the third device. </blockquote><br>  * Here it is necessary to mention the completed project Stylograph, <a href="https://oree.co/product/stylograph">whose page</a> on Amazon is currently unavailable.  The device, resembling the form of N2, apparently had its own built-in scanner, but the descriptions did not include any special markup.  The latest price for GadgetFlow is $ 350. <br><br><h4>  Equill </h4><br>  Perhaps one of the most famous <a href="https://www.myequil.com/smartpen2/">smart pens</a> with an external scanner.  For some time it was sold quite successfully in Russia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rw/gp/xd/rwgpxd-6igtkdgsgw9tpj4mpik0.jpeg"><br><br>  The principle of operation was relatively simple, and at the same time any sheets could be used: the pen was synchronized with the scanner, the scanner read data from the sheet and sent it to the application. <br><br>  The model worked steadily, and, probably, the only censures were censures to the form: it was not very convenient. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/e-pens-EPN008-EN-mobile-notes-pro/dp/B00OQ7TOWS">Mobile Notes Pro</a> , <a href="http://www.irislink.com/EN-US/c1521/IRISNotes-3---Digital-Pen.aspx">IRIS Notes</a> and some others are in the same row.  All such models will be united by one thing - for correct work it is necessary to have three elements with you: a pen, a scanner, a sheet or a notebook, which is not so convenient. <br><br><h4>  LiveScribe </h4><br>  One of the most famous manufacturers, if not to say "punchers" smart pens.  Their pens were among the first, but they were cumbersome and inconvenient. <br><br>  The biggest changes in this sense affected the <a href="https://market.yandex.ru/search%3Ftext%3Dlivescribe%25203%26suggest%3D2%26cvredirect%3D2%26local-offers-first%3D0%26deliveryincluded%3D0%26onstock%3D0">third model</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vx/nr/jf/vxnrjfixzomf1qzgsmnk7kqzldc.jpeg"><br><br>  Actually, this model became the pioneer of the “pen + special paper” concept.  Now the model is also available in Russia. <br><br><blockquote>  Many users openly resent against such a "subscription" format: take off, sit down to buy special notebooks.  This is so and not so.  NeoLab, for example, allows you to print 13 different formats of sheets in PDF, if you do not want to buy.  However, notebooks for smart pens cost from 590 rubles, which, in general, is not so expensive, given that you will have to buy notebooks with any pen! </blockquote><br><h4>  Eternal pens </h4><br>  One of the "branches" of smart pens can be recognized as "eternal" inkless pens.  At one time, the noise came <a href="https://www.popmech.ru/gadgets/47069-vechnaya-ruchka-ot-pininfarina/">from</a> Pininfarina. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/f4/yc/eo/f4yceoetvvzgjvc-hi4y0hpsj-0.jpeg"><br><br>  Also known is <a href="https://www.google.ru/search%3Fq%3Dcuban%2Bnapkin%2Bforever%26newwindow%3D1%26source%3Duniv%26tbm%3Dshop%26tbo%3Du%26sa%3DX%26ved%3D0ahUKEwj3yO3axbbZAhUJyKQKHbG2B60QsxgIKw%26biw%3D1283%26bih%3D598">Napkin</a> 's eternal pencil in the form of a Cuban cigar. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6d/kq/sl/6dkqsl_ve2aeaojopw7zzaulnnk.jpeg"><br><br><h4>  About the price of smart pens </h4><br>  Many people find that smart pens are an expensive category, but as a gift they continue to buy ordinary accessories, which cost an average of 15-20 thousand rubles, if we are talking about a gift. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-c/ly/ca/-clycaxqyqdvd6gybajj-1y5jpm.png"><br><br>  In this case, smart pens for a long time in terms of design do not stand out from the background of ordinary accessories and do not cause any discomfort during use.  Therefore, as a business gift to a man, this category, in general, has a future. <br><br>  Happy coming! </div>
