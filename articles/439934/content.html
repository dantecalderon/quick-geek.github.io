The list of analyzed documents may include regulations, industry standards, interview protocols, regulations, regulations, technical tasks and other corporate documents. <br><br>  The project analyst is <i>assigned</i> a rather <i>laborious</i> and, at the same time, <i>routine task</i> , which currently has no automation equipment.  As the analysis of modern business process modeling tools shows, even such well-known on the market applications such as <i>Enterprise Architect, Business Studio, Bizagi Modeler</i> do not have mechanisms to support building business process models based on their textual description. <br><br>  The article solves the problem of <i>extracting the BPMN-model from the document.</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><hr><br>  It should be noted that at present in the market of business process management ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process_management"><i>BPM</i></a> ) there is a technology of intellectual analysis of processes ( <a href="https://habr.com/post/244879/"><i>Process Mining</i></a> ).  However, unlike the technology described below, the input to the Process Mining system is a database with the results of the business process being modeled, and not a set of documents with its textual description. <br><br><h1>  Formulation of the problem </h1><br>  The formulation of an ideal task can be represented as a “ <i>big red button</i> ”, by pressing which the entire volume of the documents to be analyzed is automatically converted into a network of BPMN-models of the Customer’s business processes available for analysis, optimization and automation. <br><br>  Solving the problem in this formulation is a matter of the future.  We introduce a series of logical and technical constraints for a real pilot task. <br><br>  <b>Objective: To</b> minimize the complexity of building a business process model for the text description while ensuring the completeness and connectedness of the model. <br><br>  <b>At the entrance</b> there is a document in <i>Microsoft Word</i> format <i>,</i> which: <br><br><ul><li>  contains a text description of <u>one internal business process</u> ( <i>Private Business Process</i> ). </li><li>  <i>Participant</i> participates in the business process. </li><li>  the business process is described at the <u>same level of detail</u> (there are no <i>sub-</i> <u>processes</u> ). </li></ul><br>  <b>At the output</b> we get an xml file in the format <i>BPMN2.0</i> , which: <br><br><ul><li>  contains a business process model corresponding to the <u>baseline description level</u> ( <i>BPMN Descriptive Conformance Sub-Class</i> ). </li><li>  correctly opened for editing in <i>Bizagi Modeler</i> . </li></ul><br>  As a test example, we will use a text description of such a widespread process as <i>Incident Management</i> ( <i>Incident Management</i> ) from the <b>ITIL</b> standard library ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITIL"><i>Information Technology Infrastructure Library</i></a> ).  The test case is consciously taken in English.  English has no cases and is selected to facilitate the processing of references ( <i>coreferences</i> ) to the elements of a business process as part of a pilot task ( <i>this will be discussed in more detail in the second part</i> ). <br><br>  At the output, an <b>incident management</b> model “ <i>no worse than</i> ” a flowchart provided in the ITIL library should be formed.  By “ <i>not worse</i> ” criterion we will understand: the completeness and connectedness of business functions, data, decision-making conditions and participants in a business process. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5p/3d/8b/5p3d8bmicprqmuuxeiwrbb3nebs.png"><br>  <i>Figure 1. A flowchart of the Incident Management process (ITIL v.3 Official Introduction, p.98)</i> <br><br><h1>  Solution concept </h1><br>  According to the <b>BPMN</b> glossary ( <a href=""><i>Business Process Model and Notation, version 2.0</i></a> ), the business process ( <abbr title="In BPMN, there are a number of ideas for a flow of semantics,">Process</abbr> ) is represented as "the <i>graph of Flow-elements (a set of activities, events, gateways) and the Sequence Flow relationships that link them into an executable stream</i> ." <br><br>  <b>Definition</b>  By <b>BPMN-graph</b> we mean a finite, directed graph ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory"><i>Graph Theory</i></a> ) with the following extensions: <br><br><ol><li>  The vertices of the graph correspond to the BPMN-elements of the process ( <i>Flow, Data, Participant</i> ). </li><li>  The edges of the graph correspond to the BPMN process connections ( <i>Sequence Flow, Message Flow, Association</i> ). </li><li>  Vertices and edges have obligatory attributes: identifier ( <i>id</i> ), name ( <i>name</i> ), comment ( <i>documentation</i> ). </li><li>  Required vertex types are elements of the Flow category ( <i>Activity, Event, Gateway</i> ). </li><li>  Mandatory edge types are control flow connections ( <i>Sequence Flow</i> ). </li></ol><br>  <b>Statement 1.</b> Textual description of the business process in the document (in natural language) - contains the <i>BPMN graph in an implicit form</i> . <br><br>  <b>Statement 2.</b> The task of extracting BPMN models from a document belongs to the class of tasks of extracting information from weakly structured computer-readable documents ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_extraction"><i>Information extraction</i></a> ), the main subtasks of which are: <i>named entity recognition</i> , <i>relationship extraction</i> , reference <i>resolution</i> . <br><br>  Combining the algorithms <i>of graph theory</i> and <i>information extraction</i> , we obtain the following <b>solution steps</b> . <br><br><ol><li>  Document markup with BPMN tags ( <i>to identify process elements</i> ). </li><li>  Compiling BPMN tags into a BPMN process model ( <i>to identify process associations</i> ). </li><li>  Verification of the BPMN model ( <i>to resolve links</i> ). </li><li>  Correction of BPMN-model ( <i>in case of non-compliance of the model with the text description</i> ). </li><li>  Export the BPMN model to an xml file ( <i>for converting a BPMN graph to a standard format</i> ). </li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dr/c7/l6/drc7l6g7zts-dpld4c3cejnofz0.png"><br>  <i>Figure 2. Process diagram of extracting a BPMN model from a document (BPMN Text Extraction)</i> <br><br><h2>  Decision.  Step 1: Markup of the document with BPMN tags </h2><br>  For marking BPMN-elements of the business process in the document we will use <i>BPMN-tags.</i> <br><br>  <b>Definition</b>  <b>A BPMN tag</b> is a <i>colored text marker with an identifier</i> containing the type of BPMN element.  The name and color of a BPMN tag corresponds to a specific category of BPMN element. <br><br>  Below are the colors, categories and types of BPMN tags, as well as recommendations for marking up the document ( <i>finding the exact rules for identifying BPMN elements is the task of the next stage of the project</i> ). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zm/gt/xx/zmgtxx6qbl4htqzcbprtuv9bwjw.png"><br>  <i>Table 1. Description of BPMN tags</i> <br><br>  <b>The general principle for</b> performing operations with BPMN tags: highlight a piece of text containing a <i>BPMN element</i> and press the button of the corresponding <i>BPMN tag</i> . <br>  For example, to select a business process, select " <b>INCIDENT MANAGEMENT</b> ", then click the &lt; <i>Business Proces</i> s&gt; button.  The background of the selected BPMN element is colored in the color of the selected BPMN tag, and a bookmark with the BPMN tag identifier is added to the document tabs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/up/tw/df/uptwdf0wmt_qh77gtvc1f9wlatg.png"><br>  <i>Figure 3. The menu bar of the BPMN tab (a group of BPMN tags, Edit tags)</i> <br><br>  The following are the main operations on BPMN tags: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Add</b> ( <i>BPMN tag</i> ) - adds a new BPMN tag to the bookmarks of the document ( <i>Word Bookmarks</i> ) and marks the selected text with the corresponding color. </li><li>  <b>Show / Hide</b> ( <i>Show Tags</i> ) - enables / disables BPMN tags in the text of the document. </li><li>  <i>Resize</i> - changes the area of ​​the BPMN tagged text. </li><li>  <i>Delete</i> - deletes the BPMN tag (bookmark and marker) from the document. </li><li>  <b>Detailed Information</b> ( <i>Details</i> ) - shows detailed information on the BPMN tag (identifier, category, type and text of the BPMN tag). </li><li>  <b>Report</b> - shows a statistical report on the number and types of BPMN tags in the active document. </li></ul><br>  As a result of the markup of the test document, we obtain the following result. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nx/ny/pu/nxnypuurufa60ft5xb-2-b_brs4.png"></a> <br>  <i>Figure 4. BPMN markup of the text description of the Incident Management process (the image is clickable)</i> <br><br>  Note that the text has “ <i>duplicate</i> ” BPMN tags that have the same text and color (for example, <i>Service Desk, Problem Management, Incident Record</i> ) are links to the same process element.  Processing of such references ( <i>coreferences</i> ) will be considered at the 2nd step of the solution. <br><br>  To be continued… </div>
