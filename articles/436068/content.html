<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pa/la/b_/palab_a88dnl7zxnwzupyptjvdm.jpeg"><br><p>  Hello!  Imagine that C ++ Russia is no more.  Where will you go instead?  There are many conferences devoted to broader topics, but ours is one of the few, entirely focused on C ++ and openly stating that this will be a real hardcore.  A little choice.  It's good that we did not disappear anywhere!  Next time C ++ Russia <a href="https://cppconf.ru/">will be held this spring</a> . </p><br><p>  The conference will be held <strong>April 19-20 in Moscow</strong> .  Most likely, there will be an additional third day of master classes that are not included in the main program. </p><br><p>  Themes of the reports: multithreading and parallel computing, new features of the language and compilers, assembly and infrastructure of complex projects with large code bases, performance and low-level tin, metaprogramming, functional programming and other paradigms, architecture of complex projects, and much more. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1 id="keynout">  Keynout </h1><br><p>  Last time we brought Daveed Vandevoorde, and this time his co-author will come to us.  The conference will be opened by Nicolai M. Josuttis.  About Nicholas is best <a href="http://www.josuttis.com/">read on his website</a> .  It is worth noting that he is not only a master of C ++ development, but also the author of several popular books and a longtime member of the Standardization Committee in the part of libraries. </p><br><h1 id="doklady">  Reports </h1><br><p>  Now the program is at the stage of formation, there is an active work with the speakers, but there are already some information about several reports.  Let's walk through them very briefly: </p><br><p><img align="left" width="200" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hv/u2/ci/hvu2ci0d1ljy6r0qjsfqtltyx_q.jpeg">  Anton Polukhin - “Irreplaceable C ++”.  Anton has a profile on <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/antoshkka/" class="user_link">Habré</a> ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/antoshkka/" class="user_link">antoshkka</a> ) with a bunch of articles, he often speaks and talks about interesting things.  One of three people in Russia participating in the Standardization Committee (the other two are Anton Bikineev and Alexander Fokin).  I am pleased to think that it was thanks to our conferences that Russia appeared in the Committee - perhaps this is a topic for a separate story.  I don’t know if Anton should be represented here, but I’ll still do it.  Anton is the author of the Boost C ++ Application Development Cookbook.  Boost contributor, author of the Boost.TypeIndex library, Boost.Any, Boost.LexicalCast and so on.  The exact content of the report is specified, we will keep you informed. <br clear="all"></p><br><p><img align="left" width="200" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0s/fr/vi/0sfrvijyuyry2udghbn5p3ja9gk.jpeg">  Alexander Granin - “Monadic Parsers”.  I think the name is already clear :-) An excellent report from a functional programmer who understands not only C ++, but Haskell as well.  Interestingly, Alexander usually speaks not about the specific and only correct way to do things, but about a set of ideas from functional programming that you can use or not use in your C ++ code.  And Alexander is a member of the C ++ Russia Program Committee, so we will try to do a separate interview with him. <br clear="all"></p><br><p><img align="left" width="200" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ru/x1/zx/rux1zxatlvlmhvunvkurjsbqipk.jpeg">  Andrei Davydov - “Metaprogramming, sparing compiler” and “Concepts as a means to implement old classes in a new way”.  These are two reports, each occupies a full slot.  Andrey is a developer on the ReSharper C ++ team at JetBrains with a past in GIS and 3D visualization.  Initially, it was one big two-hour report, but after a series of refactorings it was divided into two independent parts.  You can only come to one of them and understand everything perfectly.  If you visit two slots in a row, it will give a more systematic picture of what is happening. <br clear="all"></p><br><p><img align="left" width="200" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yt/x7/q1/ytx7q1bsuhp1ab3b-lolgte74ng.jpeg">  Andrei Karpov - “What you need to pay attention to when reviewing the code of the library being developed”.  Andrew ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/andrey2008/" class="user_link">Andrey2008</a> ) we all know well on Habré for the articles about finding bugs in open source projects.  This time he will have a full-scale report on the fact that the library developer should pay extra attention to small details and portability issues that make him take a fresh look at many popular functions, the choice of data types, error handling, and so on. <br clear="all"></p><br><p><img align="left" width="200" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xd/kh/9g/xdkh9gxyhglrkr87gtnp4ddkhn0.jpeg">  Rainer Grimm - "Concurrency and Parallelism in C ++ 17 and C ++ 20/23".  Rainer is a developer with 20 years of experience, who has written several books about C ++ for O'Reilly and Leanpub, and from some point on - also a <a href="https://www.modernescpp.com/">professional C ++ - blogger</a> .  Permanent participants know him well, as he read reports at all C ++ Russia.  The problem of this report is obvious: starting from standard 17 and above, work with basic blocks of multithreaded applications has seriously changed and continues to change.  How exactly are things going with parallel STL in C ++ 17?  What can I say about executors, transactional memory and coroutines in C ++ 23?  It is easy to get lost in this, and there will be a report about it.  The only trap here is that Rainer has a specific German accent, and will have to get used to it. <br clear="all"></p><br><p><img align="left" width="200" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/x8/7x/hg/x87xhgz4oif8ptaxv-pgxh9krdk.jpeg">  Arno Schödl - "Text Formatting For A Future Range-Based Standard Library".  Arnaud is a director at Think-Cell, directing the work of the R &amp; D, Quality Assurance and Customer Care divisions.  The theme sounds hot, especially against the background of a recent article with an example of the use of money ( <a href="https://habr.com/post/435036/">an Habré translation of the article</a> ).  If you are also outraged (or vice versa), you have just had a great chance to talk with the author in person and find out all the sore points. <br clear="all"></p><br><p><img align="left" width="200" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hx/x3/xj/hxx3xjcmzli-zqzlwbyvohhgxjc.jpeg">  Ivan Čukić - “Move-only C ++ design”.  Ivan - Ph.Dc Computer Science at <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582">Belgrade University</a> in Serbia, explores programming languages ​​and even published the book <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-c-plus-plus">“Functional Programming in C ++”</a> .  In addition, he contributes to KDE and Plasma.  This is a report on C ++ move-semantics from a person who has been on both sides of the barricades: both as an expert in language design and as a low-level development practice. <br clear="all"></p><br><p><img align="left" width="200" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kb/lv/fu/kblvfuzk4lzggr-n84rfrih_1ig.jpeg">  Viktor Kirilov - "The hitchhiker's guide to faster builds".  This is a report on why building and linking takes such an incredibly long time, and what to do about it now.  There will be a complete analysis of the topic, starting with tuning and ending with modules in C ++.  Victor is a developer with 6 years in C ++ game development, known for a number of things like developing code loading in Nim runtime or doctest library (this is such a single-header framework for testing). <br clear="all"></p><br><h1 id="master-klassy">  Master Classes </h1><br><p>  Master classes before the main program are practiced not for the first year.  In 2017 there were two, in 2018 - already four.  Right now we understand who will come this year.  As soon as this question becomes clear, we will write about it separately in Habré. </p><br><h1 id="call-for-papers">  Call for Papers </h1><br><p>  There are still a couple of months before the conference, so you have time to submit your report.  Program committees read completely all applications and carefully consider them.  Yes, there are many famous personalities in the list of speakers, but it is quite possible to get there.  It is necessary, of course, to work well on the content and on the feed, but you will be helped by people who are well versed in this. </p><br><p>  There are very specific criteria for the adoption of the report, which can simply be met.  There is a specific process that begins with the acceptance of an application and ends with a speech at a conference. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f84/e9b/2ca/f84e9b2cad28f620d093d77f4a26c533.png"></p><br><p>  To start your journey as a speaker, you need <a href="https://cppconf.ru/callforpapers/">to follow the link</a> , read everything there carefully and do as it is written. </p><br><h1 id="dopolnitelnye-fishki">  Additional chips </h1><br><p>  Remember, at the very beginning of the post I asked: what will happen if C ++ Russia disappears?  This question was not just like that.  To continue to make conferences and reach a new level, the company <a href="https://jugru.org/">JUG.ru Group</a> joins the organization of all events.  Among other things, this means the appearance of several additional chips, which will be discussed later. </p><br><h2 id="diskussionnye-zony">  Discussion areas </h2><br><p>  After each report, the speaker goes to a dedicated discussion area, where you can talk with him and ask your questions, draw on a whiteboard, and so on.  Formally, this can be done in a break between reports.  Speakers are not required, but usually stay much longer - for example, for the duration of the next report.  Sometimes it makes sense to skip the report from the main program (if you bought a ticket, you still have records) and spend it on focused communication with an important expert. </p><br><h2 id="bof-sessii">  BoF sessions </h2><br><p>  This is something like a round table or discussion group in which everyone can take part.  Communication goes on an equal footing, there is no division of "speakers" and "listeners".  But there are “discussion moderators”.  Among the participants are usually going to a lot of cool experts who can make a great contribution to the discussion.  If suddenly it is interesting, <em>BoF</em> stands for “birds of a feather”, and its origin is counted from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_a_feather_(computing)">first IETF rallies</a> . </p><br><h2 id="ask-expert">  Ask Expert </h2><br><p>  A dedicated area at the exhibition, where you can contact an expert with your problem and get on-site practical advice.  Bring your laptops and cook questions! </p><br><h2 id="vecherinka">  A party </h2><br><p>  Drinks, snacks and music.  Communication in a relaxed atmosphere with colleagues and your favorite speaker over a glass of foam or red.  Unobtrusive music and a bar for those who love "hotter".  Warm lamp atmosphere.  Everything as you like. </p><br><h1 id="kak-stat-uchastnikom">  How to get involved </h1><br><p>  You can buy tickets <a href="https://cppconf.ru/registration/">on the official website</a> . </p><br><p>  Last year we already did a special student program and online tickets.  Please note that now this system has improved - there are several types of tickets on the site.  Choosing the right type can save a lot.  Live broadcast and videotapes there too. </p><br><p>  See you at the conference! </p></div>
