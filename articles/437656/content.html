<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Over time, everyone is faced with the need to produce large parts using additive technologies.  And household 3D printers, in their bulk, have a relatively small table for printing (a square with a side of 180 .... 220 mm).  Not much.  What to do if you want more? <br><br>  There are various interesting solutions for increasing print sizes, including huge expensive industrial printers, but there are also budget options for printing at home. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fa/dj/uq/fadjuq94jgvrmiaxxzjrfxhsnme.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Greetings to all! <br><br>  I propose to see a selection of 3D printers with a large working field.  The selection includes models with a print field of 300x300 to 400x400 mm.  The height of the models is also up to 400 mm.  All printers are relatively inexpensive, the price range in the article is from $ 289 to $ 599 for branded models, which is quite good for using the printer at home, in the office or for a small business. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/q6/zf/xt/q6zfxtbanou6obedwu_ecm7faga.jpeg"><br><br>  The leader in terms of price and working field is the <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/3d-printers-3d-printer-kits/pp_1841229.html%3Flkid%3D19090481">Alfawise U20 Large Scale 2.8 inch Touch Screen DIY 3D Printer</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yz/bt/3j/yzbt3jji2hwmti2lg3bmnxm3jj8.jpeg"><br><br>  This is an interesting 3D classic layout printer with a heated table.  Printing with popular materials is possible: PLA, ABS, PVA, PP, wood and so on.  Printing comfort provides a large 2.8 "touch screen with support for memory cards and USB drives. <br><br>  <i>Specifications:</i> <br><br>  Brand: Alfawise <br>  Type: DIY <br>  Model: U20 <br>  Engraving Area: 300 x 300 x 400mm <br>  Frame material: Aluminum Alloy <br>  Nozzle quantity: Single <br>  Nozzle diameter: 0.4mm <br>  Nozzle temperature: Room temperature to 250 degree <br>  Layer thickness: 0.1-0.4mm <br>  Memory card offline print: SD card <br>  LCD Screen: Yes <br>  Print speed: 20 - 150mm / s <br>  Supporting material: ABS, PLA, PP, PVA, Wood Filled <br>  Material diameter: 1.75mm <br>  Language: Chinese, English <br>  File format: G-code, STL <br>  XY-axis positioning accuracy: 0.012mm <br>  Z-axis positioning accuracy: 0.004mm <br>  Voltage: 24V <br>  Host computer software: Cura, Repetier-Host <br>  Packing Type: unassembled packing <br>  System support: Windows / Linux / MAC <br>  Connector Type: SD card, USB <br><br>  I attach a small video review of the printer - last time they asked for additional information on the models. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LJy8IYpsRDk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The printer is large, comes partially disassembled (removed vertical portal).  The assembly is simple to ugliness and takes a minimum of time.  The printer is already flashed and configured, just set (check) the table by level and start the test print.  Provided for auto calibration. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/j6/xg/nr/j6xgnrwffy8hz1kgpxsr_vc0vso.jpeg"><br><br>  The next champion in this race is the <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/3d-printers-3d-printer-kits/pp_1821953.html%3Flkid%3D19090481">large A30 Aluminum printer from Geeetech</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mx/in/mg/mxinmg714dkmmj-hlqjx0mbwlyi.jpeg"><br><br>  This model is slightly more expensive, it has a slightly larger print area (320 x 320 x 420mm). <br>  Of the important "chips" I note support for Wi-Fi connections and work through the EasyPrint 3D application from a PC, tablet and smartphone.  To increase adhesion, a special glass, similar to Ultrabase, is installed on the table (silicon carbide glass with a special matte finish).  As a self-calibration, a 3D touch sensor is provided.  I note the presence of the filament sensor.  If the spool of thread has run out, the printer will simply pause.  After the “refill” printing will continue. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oo/zq/qv/oozqqvqwog-rab32ai1xbq-sucw.jpeg"><br><br>  <i>Specifications:</i> <br><br>  Brand: Geeetech <br>  Type: DIY <br>  Model: A30 <br>  Frame material: Aluminum <br>  Nozzle diameter: 0.4mm <br>  Product forming size: 320 x 320 x 420mm <br>  Memory card offline print: TF card <br>  Print speed: 80 - 110mm / s <br>  File format: G-code, OBJ, STL <br>  XY-axis positioning accuracy: 0.011mm <br>  Z-axis positioning accuracy: 0.0025mm <br>  System support: Windows, MAC, Linux <br>  Size: Large <br>  Connector Type: SD card, USB <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0g/el/7v/0gel7v3ckjvabsk6vv4ltbh1zfk.jpeg"><br><br>  I also note that this 3D printer also requires partial assembly. <br>  The list of printer functions is represented by the icons below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dl/gm/sh/dlgmshblmdymqynv5mtwiojfrfc.jpeg"><br><br>  Probably the most popular large printer from Creality3D. <br><br>  This <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/3d-printers-3d-printer-kits/pp_009343563461.html%3Flkid%3D19090481">Creality3D CR - 10S Pro 300 x 300 x 400 3D Printer</a> is a printer with a print area of ​​300 x 300 x 400 mm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/em/s9/al/ems9alx8gxvn8f8u021rjrekcpm.jpeg"><br><br>  <i>Specifications:</i> <br><br>  Brand: Creality3D <br>  Type: DIY <br>  Model: CR - 10S Pro <br>  Frame material: Aluminum <br>  Product forming size: 300 x 300 x 400mm <br>  Molding Technology: FDM <br>  Printing Speed: ≤180mm / s, ordinary printing speed 30 - 60mm / s <br>  Print Accuracy: ± 0.1mm <br>  Printing Height: 0.1 - 0.4mm <br>  Nozzle Number: 1 <br>  Nozzle Temperature: ≤260 ° C <br>  Hot Bed Temperature: ≤110 ° C <br>  Working Mode: print online or offline with a TF card <br>  File Format: STL, OBI, AMF <br>  Power Supply Parameters: 100 - 240V 5.9A 50 / 60Hz input, DC 24V 21A output <br>  Printing Power: 480W <br>  Printing Material: PLA, ABS, PVA, PP, wood filled, etc. <br>  Consumable Diameter: 1.75mm <br><br>  The layout is quite convenient - the power supply and control unit is built into the “bottom” of the printer, and does not occupy a separate place on the table.  There is also a filament sensor, pause and print recovery, and a touchscreen display. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wi/tq/yu/witqyuhliaykubz3liu1vb6gm2m.jpeg"><br><br>  Regarding the qualitative differences, I would like to note the presence of a special extruder with double gear (Geared extruder), which ensures a steady supply of even soft plastics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kq/4q/ch/kq4qchcgzst91sfitctpsmhgkiu.jpeg"><br><br>  Another representative of such 3D printers is the <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/3d-printers-3d-printer-kits/pp_009318453116.html%3Flkid%3D19090481">Xvico X5 Aluminum Alloy 3D Printer 400 x 400 x 400mm</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/do/ux/im/douximeacavwo7cxp3mppe4hote.jpeg"><br><br>  This printer is even larger (the table is not 300x300, but 400x400 mm).  Also has a pause, filament sensor, auto level. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yh/jn/o4/yhjno4guysbno1ciwd955kcmfwo.jpeg"><br><br>  <i>Specifications:</i> <br><br>  Brand: Xvico <br>  Type: DIY <br>  Model: X5 <br>  Machine material: aluminum alloy profile + sheet metal <br>  Nozzle diameter: 0.4mm <br>  Printing accuracy: + / - 0.1 - 0.2mm <br>  Layer thickness: 0.1 - 0.4mm <br>  Printing method: SD card <br>  Display: 2.8-inch color touch screen <br>  Machine speed: 10 - 300mm / s <br>  Printing speed: 20-200mm / s <br>  Extrusion head temperature (highest): 260Deg.C <br>  Hot bed maximum temperature (highest): 100Deg.C <br>  XY axis positioning accuracy: 0.012mm <br>  Z axis positioning accuracy: 0.004mm <br>  Printing materials: ABS, PLA, TPU <br>  Consumable diameter: 1.75mm <br>  Operating language: Chinese English <br>  Software format: STL, OBJ, JPG <br>  Print file format: Gcode <br>  Operating system: Windows, MAC <br><br>  Well, in conclusion, the revival of the legend. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/3d-printers-3d-printer-kits/pp_009449214306.html%3Flkid%3D19090481">Huge metal printer Anet A8 Plus Aluminum Frame 3D Printer</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/by/s8/ot/bys8otylhcr2kn5diwrf6j-fiz8.jpeg"><br><br>  <i>Specifications:</i> <br>  Brand Name: Anet <br>  Type: DIY <br>  Nozzle quantity: Single <br>  Nozzle diameter: 0.4mm <br>  Nozzle temperature: Room temperature to 250 degree <br>  Product forming size: 300 x 300 x 350mm <br>  Layer thickness: 0.1-0.4mm <br>  Memory card offline print: TF card <br>  LCD Screen: Yes <br>  Print speed: 10 - 120mm / s <br>  Supporting material: ABS, HIPS, PA, Wood, PETG, PLA <br>  Material diameter: 1.75mm <br>  Language: Chinese, English <br>  File format: G-code, JPG, OBJ, STL <br>  Model supporting function: Yes <br>  XY-axis positioning accuracy: 0.012mm <br>  Z-axis positioning accuracy: 0.004mm <br>  Voltage: 24V <br>  Working Power: 220V / 110V / 360W <br>  Host computer software: Cura <br>  Packing Type: unassembled packing <br>  System support: Windows, Mac OS <br>  Voltage Range: 100-240V <br>  Current (mA): 15A <br>  Connector Type: TF card, USB <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ux/5x/lh/ux5xlhciqai0opnybtfkrqyl1au.jpeg"><br><br>  This printer is the only one that has cylindrical guides, and also comes unassembled.  Unlike the usual Anet A8, this model already has a number of improvements that improve the rigidity of the frame and print quality as a whole.  The print area is 300 x 300 x 350 mm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-m/wm/v0/-mwmv0w-ovwmvz9uadokitsurwk.jpeg"><br><br>  In any case, the presented printers will help in case you need to print a lot in every sense.  The built-in print pause will help out when the coil is replaced, when power is lost (the printer will continue to print from the point of stop), as well as in the case of layer-by-layer color printing.  Pre-assembled printers allow you to print "from a cold start," it just takes time to install and fix the vertical part (portal), as well as the connection of electronics.  It is recommended to level the table before printing.  Models with adhesive coating is preferable, since the edges stick off is especially important when printing large models.  In this regard, Geeetech A30 looks great with special tempered glass. <br><br>  Hope my collection was helpful! </div>
