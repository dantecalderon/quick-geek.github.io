<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Earlier, the Federation Council discussed the introduction of IMEI blacklists in Russia to automatically block devices that were stolen or imported to bypass legal procedures without paying the appropriate fee (for example, bought on Aliexpress).  According to distributors, illegal imports are especially prevalent in the Chinese brand smartphone sector (the company Marvel-Distribution calls the brands DJI, Meizu, VIVO, Xiaomi), where the share of gray smartphones is 10%, and in some moments gray import is 50% of all import. <br><br>  Now the Association of E-commerce Companies (ACIT) has developed an appropriate concept for regulating mobile devices using IMEI numbers, Kommersant <a href="https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/3534038">reports</a> .  It includes white, gray and black lists IMEI. <br><br><ul><li>  Whitelist: codes allowed for import and use </li><li>  Gray list: non-unique IMEI, temporarily not prohibited to use (for the transfer to the white list, the user must show proof of legal purchase of the device at the operator’s office) </li><li>  Black list: IMEI prohibited to use stolen or illegally imported devices </li></ul><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ACIT has also developed a soft “certification” scheme, which will not afford much for ordinary customers: <br><br><ul><li>  You can take 1 smartphone for a year for free </li><li>  For the second device, the fee will be $ 20 </li><li>  For the third and each subsequent - $ 30 </li><li>  In the absence of documents confirming the legality of the importation fee will be $ 40 </li></ul><br>  When importing a phone from abroad, the user will have to register it in the registry. <br><br>  All mobile devices that have a SIM card will enter the IMEI registry.  These are mobile phones, tablets, routers and security alarms.  Most likely, the registry will be created on the basis of the Central Research Institute of Communications at Rossvyaz. <br><br>  Now ACIT has sent a document to Lyudmila Bokova, Chairperson of the Temporary Commission of the Federation Council for the Development of the Information Society, and Mikhail Abyzov, Minister of the Open Government.  Rossvyaz considers the basic provisions of the ACIT concept to be “correct and reasonable”: such a system is widely used in the world, department officials said. <br><br>  Judging by the preliminary analysis of the “certification” scheme, it will hit gray dealers who sell smartphones cheaply.  Thus, the scheme encourages users to independently order phones in Chinese stores, rather than buying them from dealers. <br><br>  ACIT offers a transition period of up to three years for the gradual introduction of the system. </div>
