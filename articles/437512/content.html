<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Pure functions are the building blocks of functional programming.  They are adored for simplicity and testability. <br><br>  In this article you will find a <i>checklist</i> that will help determine whether a net function or not. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/38b/e1d/718/38be1d718558cd9eff455c9d5870f7c8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Check list </h3><br>  <i>A function must satisfy two conditions in order to be considered “pure”:</i> <br><br>  - Each time the function returns the same result when it is called with the same set of arguments. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  - No side effects <br><br>  Consider more. <br><br><h3>  1. Single input =&gt; Single output </h3><br>  Compare this to: <br><br><pre><code class="plaintext hljs">const add = (x, y) =&gt; x + y; add(2, 4); // 6</code> </pre> <br>  With this: <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">let x = 2; const add = (y) =&gt; { x += y; }; add(4); // x === 6 (the first time)</code> </pre> <br>  In the first case, the value is returned based on the specified parameters, regardless of where / when you call it. <br><br>  If you add 2 and 4, always get 6. <br><cut></cut><br>  Nothing affects the result. <br><br>  <b>Unclean functions = inconsistent results</b> <br><br>  The second example returns nothing.  He relies on the general condition to do his job by increasing the variable outside of his scope. <br><br>  This model is a nightmare for developers. <br><br>  The shared state introduces a dependence on time.  You get different results depending on when you called the function.  The first time result is 6, the next time 10 and so on. <br><br>  <b>What's better?</b> <br><br>  In which case you get less bugs that appear only under certain conditions? <br><br>  In which case, are you more likely to succeed in a multi-threaded environment where temporal dependencies can break the system? <br><br>  Definitely in the first. <br><br><h3>  2. No side effects </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fb5/e5c/46a/fb5e5c46ad24392e77c78d8aff1a8436.jpg" alt="image"><br><cut></cut><br>  This test is itself a checklist. <br><br>  <i>Examples of side effects:</i> <br><br><ol><li>  Modifying input parameters </li><li>  console.log </li><li>  HTTP calls (AJAX / fetch) </li><li>  File system change </li><li>  DOM Requests </li></ol><br>  In fact, any work performed by a function is not related to the calculation of the final result. <br><br>  I advise you to watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Ftime_continue%3D950%26v%3D7Zlp9rKHGD4">video of</a> Bob Martin. <br><br>  Here is the “unclean” side effect function. <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">const impureDouble = (x) =&gt; { console.log('doubling', x); return x * 2; }; const result = impureDouble(4); console.log({ result });</code> </pre> <br>  <b>console.log</b> here is a side effect, but it doesn't hurt.  We still get the same results, given the same data. <br><cut></cut><br>  However, this can cause problems. <br><br>  “Unclean” object change <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">const impureAssoc = (key, value, object) =&gt; { object[key] = value; }; const person = { name: 'Bobo' }; const result = impureAssoc('shoeSize', 400, person); console.log({ person, result });</code> </pre> <br>  The person variable has been changed forever because the function was declared through an assignment operator. <br><cut></cut><br>  A shared state means that the effect of <i>impureAssoc is</i> no longer completely obvious.  Understanding the impact on the system now includes tracking every variable it has ever touched and knowing its history. <br><br>  <i>Shared state = time dependencies.</i> <br><br>  We can clear <i>impureAssoc</i> by simply returning a new object with the desired properties. <br><br>  <b>“Clearing it”</b> <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">const pureAssoc = (key, value, object) =&gt; ({ ...object, [key]: value }); const person = { name: 'Bobo' }; const result = pureAssoc('shoeSize', 400, person); console.log({ person, result });</code> </pre> <br>  Now <i>pureAssoc</i> returns the test result, and you should not worry if it changes somewhere else. <br><cut></cut><br>  It was possible to do this: <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">const pureAssoc = (key, value, object) =&gt; { const newObject = { ...object }; newObject[key] = value; return newObject; }; const person = { name: 'Bobo' }; const result = pureAssoc('shoeSize', 400, person); console.log({ person, result });</code> </pre> <br>  Changing input data can be dangerous, but changing their copy is not a problem.  The end result is a tested, predictable function that works no matter where and when you call it. <br><br>  Changes are limited to this small area, and you still return value. <br><cut></cut><br>  <b>Summary</b> <br><br><ul><li>  The function is pure if it has no side effects and returns the same result each time when it is called with the same set of arguments. </li><li>  Side effects include: changing input, HTTP calls, writing to disk, displaying. </li><li>  You can safely clone and then change the input parameters.  Just leave the original unchanged. </li><li>  The distribution syntax (... syntax) is the easiest way to clone objects and arrays. </li></ul></div>
