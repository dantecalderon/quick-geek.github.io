<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  <i>Hut, hut, turn to me in front!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>It is more convenient to refill ink.</i> </p><br><p>  The posts about the "Factory of Print" in our blog is already a dime a dozen: </p><br><ul><li>  about color printers and MFPs - <a href="https://geektimes.ru/article/279514/">here</a> and <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/epson/blog/247598/">here</a> ; </li><li>  about monochrome - <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/epson/blog/249802/">here</a> ; </li><li>  about the update of the line after 5 years of success in the market - <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/epson/blog/271914/">here</a> . </li></ul><br><p>  Therefore, I will not spread the thought on the tree and go straight to the point. </p><br><p>  <b>In December 2017, a significant part of the Epson Print Factory series was updated.</b> </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hl/pu/xi/hlpuxinddzzzhxsbicpysh_8lby.jpeg"></div><br><p>  Of the most notable and interesting changes: </p><br><ul><li>  the design of refueled tanks has changed - they are now <i>frontal</i> and tightly fixed in the device case; </li><li>  containers themselves were updated, and, in my opinion, very successfully, so to speak, “for people” (more on this below). </li><li>  for the first time in printers and MFPs, a device <i>with a newest <a href="http://www.epson.ru/technology/printing/1093717/">PrecisionCore</a> print head appeared</i> , which previously only Epson business devices could boast of. </li></ul><br><p>  Now a little more about the changes and, in fact, the very line of devices. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Improvement number 1.  Sideways ahead </h2><br><p>  So, the capacity for refilling ink "moved" from the side of the printer - in the front.  What does this give?  It became more convenient to refill the printer: you can put it on the shelf and ... and that’s all.  Remove and move tanks for refueling, as it was necessary to do earlier, is no longer required.  Open the front cover, tilt the valve lever and refuel. </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ie/sc/hr/ieschrinvirrej7hvjshzkv4fkw.jpeg"></div><br><p>  In addition, it became much easier to track the level of ink remaining on the front-mounted containers. </p><br><p>  Well, thanks to a change in the design of the device have become much smaller.  30% interest, at least: </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hs/ip/0o/hsip0oqn4gdblehsl7iwx9si_rc.jpeg"></div><br><h2>  Improvement number 2.  The system of refilling ink "Key Lock" and "Ink Lock" ink containers of a new generation - not a drop by! </h2><br><p>  Did you happen to be distracted by <i>[substitute any event that could distract at such a crucial moment]</i> confuse the colors of ink tanks and fill in with purple instead of cyan ink?  Or do not get the tip of the container with ink in the hole and get dirty when refueling? </p><br><p>  So, <b>now each container with ink has its own unique shape of the nozzle</b> , suitable only for the corresponding filling hole on the principle of a key with a lock.  Do not miss and do not confuse. </p><br><p>  Just watch this demo (not entirely, the refueling is shown at 0:30): </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FRFrNgFcRrM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  I ran the Factory with my own hands, which came to our office to replace the previous model, and in the wild delight of this engineering solution, including because ... </p><br><p>  <i>Ink is no longer spilled!</i> </p><br><p>  As shown in the video above, the design of the valve installed in the container is designed in such a way that the ink supply is always blocked when the container is not inserted into its “groove” on the device itself (the so-called “Ink Lock” system).  In fact, the open container with ink is now <i>vertically</i> inserted into the printer, and after refueling it is removed in the same way, and at the same time - not a drop by! </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/my/kk/aj/mykkajxqmagu6_h9w8y7-lzp69u.jpeg"></div><br><p>  I can not explain why I so admire this decision.  Perhaps this is because I myself am a techie by education and do not cease to rejoice in the fruits of engineering thought, realized in the most ordinary-looking everyday things that surround us.  Now, among them, finally, and gas station "Print Factory". </p><br><h2>  Improvement number 3.  Black pigment - all without exception </h2><br><p>  In addition to what I have already mentioned, in all updated models with frontal capacities, black ink is only <b>pigmented</b> .  What is the advantage of the pigment over the water-soluble ink, I think, it is not necessary to explain once again, so I will simply list the main ones: </p><br><ul><li>  the pigment is perfectly fixed on paper <i>(because it is abrasive)</i> ; </li><li>  does not spread when water enters or is released by a marker <i>(because it is perfectly fixed)</i> ; </li><li>  does not fade with time <i>(because the pigment)</i> . </li></ul><br><p>  Therefore, to print text (and especially for long-term archival storage) pigment ink is an ideal option. </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wb/f_/9s/wbf_9s4fypzn6quuexhyyljf64q.jpeg"></div><br><h2>  What models have such improvements </h2><br><p>  In the line of devices for the home are already two such multifunction devices: <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/printers/epson-l4150/">Epson L4150</a> and <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/printers/epson-l4160/">Epson L4160</a> . </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/um/i0/n1/umi0n19whnm4-rdlrcbu-mw4ssm.png"></div><br><p>  If you choose a color multifunction printer “more serious”, I mean <b>for the office</b> , you can choose one of three new products: <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/printers/epson-l6160/">Epson L6160</a> , <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/printers/epson-l6170/">Epson L6170</a> and <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/printers/epson-l6190/">Epson L6190</a> <i>(will be available in February — March)</i> . </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/p_/ku/mo/p_kumopg-0ybjqvo0lhrfrlrclc.png"></div><br><p>  In addition to these advantages and the availability of "office" chips, such as the front tray for printing a large volume of documents, <b>removable waste ink tank</b> (yes, and then a pleasant surprise - you will no longer need to contact the service, you can change the diapers yourself) Ethernet connections, “six-thousand” models are equipped with the latest generation print head - <a href="http://epson.ru/publication/news/1092679/">Epson PrecisionCore</a> . </p><br><p>  <i>Mandatory pathos video (you can not watch):</i> </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g5-Ym8sPgfo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  Until recently, this technology was used only in professional wide-format and business printers designed for very large print volumes (for example, <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/epson/blog/243481/">Epson WorkForce Pro RIPS cartridgeless printers</a> or our incredibly fast flagship <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/epson/blog/289837/">Epson WorkForce Enterprise</a> with print speeds of up to 100 ppm). </p><br><p>  Now productive printing heads began to be installed in printers for small offices. </p><br><p>  This printing technology was created to level the difference in the quality of prints made on laser and inkjet printers.  At the same time, Epson PrecisionCore allows you to “speed up” print speeds, retaining the color saturation inherent in inkjet printing, high fade resistance and the ability to work with different media (papers). </p><br><h2>  At last </h2><br><p>  Returning to the "chips" of new office line devices, I would like to point out a <b>double set of ink containers that comes with the delivery</b> .  It is enough to print up to 11,200 color and 14,000 b / w prints.  As the saying goes: nothing, but nice. </p><br><p>  The same can be said about Wi-Fi - all five models have it: home and business.  Well, as it were, the 2018th year in the yard, Wi-Fi is even screwed into the teapots ... </p><br><p>  Very soon, new items will be tested <a href="http://epson.ru/demo/">in our "showrooms"</a> . </p><br><i></i><p>  Zasim I will take my leave and gladly answer your questions. </p><br>  <i>(I will tell you about the update of the five-thousand series of projectors promised in the previous post very soon, as early as next week, how I will introduce and agree on urgent changes.)</i> </div>
