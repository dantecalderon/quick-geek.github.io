The plot of the original game - the development of a network of hospitals, which should bring money.  At the same time, it is necessary to keep a balance between the desire to earn as much as possible and the feelings of the patients who come to receive treatment.  As far as can be judged, the primary intention of the game is preserved, there is also humor here, and it is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DT6TPTiOCuVk">quite good</a> . <br><br>  The original was introduced in 1997, the game was released on PC and on the first PlayStation.  The developers have added a large amount of black humor, which in this game was very helpful.  As mentioned above, the main thing that a player should do here is to make money.  Patients are considered as a source of profit, an inexhaustible flow of money is extracted with the help of patients and ... yes, their dead bodies. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TsxYNuCRl10" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  There are also patients who suffer from physical problems and those who have a "sick soul."  For example, there are patients with Elvis Presley syndrome.  By the way, you can play as usual, using DOSBox - DOS emulator, and using the new <a href="http://corsixth.com/">CorsixTH mod</a> .  In this version, a higher resolution, fewer bugs, an excellent system of preservation.  In general, if you want to feel the spirit of the first part, this mod is what the doctor ordered. <br><br>  Initially, the game looks like a typical "tamagotchi" with a higher level of complexity.  In fact, several genres are concentrated here at once, generously flavored with the black humor mentioned above.  Players need to build new buildings and offices, hire and remove doctors, conduct research on complex and rare diseases.  What comes out in the end, it is difficult to call the "hospital of a dream."  In the same SIMS, for example, a person can create a home from his dream, with the situation that he likes.  But there is no - most of the actions must be performed on the basis of urgent need, and not personal desires.  Otherwise, the hospital will become bankrupt and the game will end.  The screenshot above is just an example of an unsuccessful leadership. <br><br>  The hospital manager must deal equally well with his responsibilities in both poor and rich regions.  If in a poor area the hospital begins to flourish, then the manager is sent to manage another project in a more affluent area.  In order to complete the level, you need to achieve certain indicators: to cure some patients, maintain the hospital's reputation at the proper level, bring the cost of the object to the desired price, start a bank account and put some money.  All this is somewhat similar to the ratings by which <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/08/08/best-hospitals-america/">hospitals are</a> rated in the USA. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WYkUsrMAFdo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The trailer of the game, if anyone does not remember, is very entertaining.  In the hospital waiting room you can see a variety of interesting personalities like the devil.  The screensaver shows a hero doctor who is sent to save the life of a patient after being brought in by helicopter.  But bad luck - when scanning a credit card, it turns out that the patient has no money.  And then the doctor-hero dumps him into the hatch for defaulters, located directly in the operating room. <br><br>  The game itself is imbued with the idea that if a person does not have money, he must die.  Actually, this is what happens in many countries - there are no funds for proper medical care?  Then you have to eke out a miserable existence.  In the US, the lack of proper health insurance increases the risk of patient death by <a href="http://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2635326/relationship-health-insurance-mortality-lack-insurance-deadly">almost 30%</a> . <br><br>  Well, in Theme Hospital, a patient without money can be sent by a doctor to an automatic device that performs an autopsy.  The patient dies, but the hospital receives new data and technology.  Waste-free production as it is.  The hospital manager may hire not experienced doctors and nurses who need to pay a lot, but newbies.  They are often mistaken, but that such - but the savings are very significant. <br><br>  Continued, Two Points Hospital, was developed by Gary Carr and Mark Webley, members of the development team of the first version of the hospital business simulator.  According to the trailer of the new part, it is clear that the black humor and hints in the Two Points Hospital will be no less than in the previous part. </div>
