<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Xiaomi builds an ecosystem and seeks to cover all aspects of the lives of users, not only Chinese, but also residents of other countries.  However, there is some inconsistency in the development of the giant: strange collaborations are replaced by excellent integrated solutions (such as smart home), uninteresting smart sneakers are adjacent to cool training designers.  All this attracts attention to the technogiant with greater force.  We have collected interesting novelties and gadgets that have surprised us - and do not believe it, there is not a single smartphone among them.  There will be no more teasers - read everything under the cut. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/gearbest/blog/298537/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d95/2a7/50c/d952a750c523fc51bb0beb00196fdc02.png"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Sports bracelets and smart watches: evolution </h2><br>  At the end of 2016, the Xiaomi Mi Band fitness bracelet ranked second among sales of smart bracelets, leaving Apple and Garmin behind and allowing itself to overtake only Fitbit. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6ee/158/bf7/6ee158bf7884571e03c7a7f3dbfc6338.png"></div><br>  In general, the Mi Band turned out to be the ideal promo of the company - a small (ridiculous!) Price, all the necessary functions, stylish, light.  Yes, not every company contact with one potential user costs so much!  And then they sold the product, and got an army of fans, and attracted attention to the brand.  And once the movie is successful, it means you need to <s>spoil</s> everything and improve and release a sequel, remake or a painted version.  This is one of the false laws of marketing, everything is fine. <br><br>  So there was a smart watch series AMAZFIT.  Of course, this is not a spoiled, but quite successful version, but with a fairly wide and varied in terms of price ruler.  Let's look at a couple of the best representatives of Xiaomi AMAZFIT - and they are really the best, each in his own. <br><br>  The first is a <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/smart-watches/pp_1426627.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">small bracelet</a> in the usual “Miendo-swag” format for $ 57. 76. The device includes a pedometer, a sleep monitor, alerts on mobile and social networking events, a pulse sensor, a calendar, an acceleration sensor, a calorie counter.  In addition, the bracelet shows the weather forecast.  The gadget is equipped with an IPS-screen and a 170 mAh battery, which provides 12 days of work in standby mode (you don’t always have it).  Materials - stainless steel + silicone.  The bracelet is waterproof, can withstand immersion to a depth of 50 meters. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/661/ac9/12b/661ac912bd809d8c086ec4609d6dd831.png"></div><br>  The next option is <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/smart-watches/pp_605469.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">Xiaomi Huami AMAZFIT</a> for $ 156.88.  This is a more catchy sports design and another form.  But, you see, a bracelet is not a reason to cost three times as much.  The first difference is the built-in GPS tracker, which "removes" the exact route and distance.  The device includes a clock, a pulse meter, a speedometer, a calorie counter, and is able to take into account the height and even the pedal frequency of the bicycle.  Standardly transmits alerts about calls, messages, mail, alarm signals.  Battery - 280 mAh, built-in 4 GB memory, 512 MB RAM.  Materials: bracelet - silicone, case - ceramics.  The protection level is IP67 (diving up to 1 m for no more than 30 minutes) - in general, wash your hands, swim a little at the sea. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fa1/ce1/a3c/fa1ce1a3c8bd2ee5c321403ced24262a.png"></div><br>  There is a version even more expensive - with a leather strap and stainless steel case, but we will not speak about it in detail today.  The fact is that it supports only Chinese, that is, it is completely for the amateur polyglot.  However, if anyone needs it - here is the <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/smart-watches/pp_1541400.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">link</a> .  By the way, this model costs already more than $ 300, while, apart from materials, there are almost no special differences. <br><br>  Is there a difference between the two models we have considered?  Of course there is: the second watch is music via Bluetooth, and more expensive materials, and tangible software quality, and powerful technical characteristics.  In general, it all depends on your goals: sports, image, and perhaps purely experimental.  Frankly, both models are good. <br><br><h2>  Office change </h2><br>  Just a month ago, the author of the article had to look for a small comfortable silver radio mouse for a silver laptop as a gift for a woman’s hand.  So what do you think is easy?  Not, no so much.  As a result, a tiny white Logitek mouse with silver “stripes” on the sides was bought.  And it turns out there was a more relevant request option. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/mouse/pp_566739.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">Xiaomi portable mouse</a> with a Bluetooth module for $ 17.50 is a convenient, sensitive, small manipulator that will bypass many market players in terms of solving office tasks.  The sensitivity of 1200DPI allows you to work calmly with both office and graphic programs and even clapping in some games (but, of course, if you are not a fanatical gamer).  The compact and durable design ensures the survival of the mouse during falls, clamps in a laptop bag and other troubles.  The mouse is suitable for both elegant female and large male hands.  In general, an inexpensive universal mouse.  And for her there is a <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/home-gadgets/pp_238955.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">rug</a> for $ 20.29, which is not a shame to give to friends or the boss.  Comfortable, anti-slip, metallized and no frills - what we need. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/515/eb7/c8d/515eb7c8dc976d8e69dd398d59a9ed6a.png"></div><br><h2>  Let there be light </h2><br>  What makes Xiaomi really beautiful is the many clever lamps, lights, etc.  From the latter - <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/speakers/pp_1633710.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">a candle-shaped lamp with a built-in Bluetooth speaker</a> .  It can be argued a hundred times that you are an old IT person and you do not know the words of love, but this gadget creates an unrealistically romantic atmosphere due to the flickering of a warm “flame”. So for $ 20 a sin is not to make a surprise for the second half.  By the way, a 1200 mAh battery will allow you to take a lamp to the sea, to the river or to hike for the sake of a surprise. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e13/55f/e43/e1355fe434bca376f66cd3fc40d111a6.png"></div><br>  Another lamp that invariably pleases the owners belongs to the <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/ceiling-lights/pp_596249.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">Xiaomi Yeelight Smart</a> series of ceiling lights.  This is a round flat lamp with excellent luminosity, which is absolutely suitable for any interior due to its neutrality.  But the characteristics of the lamp are outstanding: dust-proof housing, control using a smartphone, integration with the smart home system.  240 LEDs are responsible for a uniform, bright but soft lighting, the luminous flux is 2000 Lm.  It is possible to adjust the mode of moonlight - a comfortable lighting solution for relaxing before bedtime.  One such lamp can illuminate 15 square meters and is ready to serve for 25,000 hours (about 3 years). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/206/b17/29c/206b1729ce98fc82c1252c62b818a72c.png"></div><br><h2>  a traveling mood </h2><br>  The holiday season is just around the corner, and some generally prefer to travel in the low season to enjoy other countries without crowds of tourists, prices that have gone up and stuffiness.  And here Xiaomi literally rolled out great solutions - suitcases on wheels. <br><br>  The first, the most inexpensive ($ 128. 89) - <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/luggage-travel-bags/pp_1058755.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">waterproof ultra-light suitcase</a> with a fabric cover.  Hard enough strong case will keep your things even at throwing.  Additional protection - a combination lock clamping lightning dogs - no additional locks to buy.  The front compartment contains pockets for tablets and laptops - very convenient if you travel by train and you need to constantly remove and tidy up your gadgets (for example, work on the go). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/759/355/b65/759355b650bddd6f1cd7cef411da000c.png"></div><br><br>  <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/luggage-travel-bags/pp_981012.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">The second suitcase is larger - 28 inches</a> , and more rigid, it has corner fittings for extra strength and durability.  This option is more suitable for long-haul flights and long business trips. <br><br>  But the most interesting is the <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/luggage-travel-bags/pp_1180255.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">third Xiaomi suitcase</a> with Bluetooth 4.0 support.  This suitcase costs $ 435.  69. It is made of lightweight aluminum-magnesium alloy, which means it is resistant to scratches and chips.  Thanks to Bluetooth, the suitcase can be blocked and unlocked using a smartphone - and this is another anti-theft measure (although it interfered with whom).  The suitcase has two handles, additional security locks and increased moisture resistance.  Another advantage - fortified, large and quiet when moving the wheels.  They make the suitcase look like an SUV in terrain and indestructibility. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c9c/265/ed6/c9c265ed6e78e90870c8be650244045b.png"></div><br>  By the way, since it was a question of traveling, do not forget to take an action camera.  Now the interest in them begins to subside - it seems that all the experiments that someone wanted to conduct, have already been carried out.  But without it on vacation as without hands - a light gadget is able to save the warmest memories.  For example, we have such a <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/action-cameras/pp_712894.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">Xiaomi Mijia Camera Mini 4K 30fps</a> for $ 138.65.  It is just tiny, but very impressive in characteristics: 2.4-inch display, shooting as 4K, coverage of a 145-degree panorama, three-axis gyroscope and perfect stabilization, 1450 mAh battery (continuous shooting about 2 hours). <br><div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/action-cameras/pp_712894.html%3Flkid%3D10721409"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ea7/083/72c/ea708372c2e8d7897e27c1bcf819c122.png"></a> </div><br>  But when you return from vacation and want to relive the best moments again, show them to parents and friends or warm up with summer shots overcast and freezing winter, you will need a good screen.  Of the latter, we liked the TV Xiaomi - <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/desktop-computer-monitor/pp_659716.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">Xiaomi Mi TV</a> .  43-inch FullHD screen with a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels and a 178-degree viewing angle will allow you to view the smallest details in any video.  Naturally, the TV is smart, works on the Android OS, can display content based on recommendations and supports gesture control.  So, if your child is still being conducted for miracles in the age of technical progress, you can transform the usual “One-two-three, show cartoons” into a spell and a hand touch.  In general - an excellent smart TV that can find its niche in the market. <br><div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/desktop-computer-monitor/pp_659716.html%3Flkid%3D10721409"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9ea/885/bff/9ea885bff699ebda06b551f4a51ce769.png"></a> </div><br><h2>  If there are children in the house who need to take up DIY </h2><br>  Designers help the child to develop, while modern designers with electronics elements develop engineering inclinations, teach them to program, work with PCs, and understand robotics.  And most importantly, you yourself can be a mentor to your children and not get bored for a second. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/96b/285/ebd/96b285ebd2f6084b3fac3bd878ec589f.png"></div><br>  <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/rc-robot/pp_934459.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">Block robot designer Xiaomi</a> for $ 119.  80 is suitable for children from 8 years old and will help them to form a primary interest in engineering specialties, modeling and programming.  From the proposed blocks, you can assemble a combat robot, a car, a tank or a motorcycle and control them through an application on a smartphone.  By the way, it is possible to supplement the robot with a <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/block-toys/pp_571922.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">cheaper option</a> and arrange, for example, a battle of robots or a competition between dad and son or two children.  Agree, 200 bucks for two sets of an intelligent designer is much cheaper than the promoted analogue.  And if you haven’t heard anything at all and haven’t read about Xiaomi designers, you can evaluate the quality and rules of work with the help of a very <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/rc-robot/pp_1590394.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">small set</a> (305 parts) for $ 46.99.  By the way, this set can be used to explain the child physics and mechanics.  But remember, this is already a mechanical toy, without computer brains, so there will be several times less pleasure and impressions. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d86/acb/b88/d86acbb88198476ac111c0fee89a703a.png"></div><br>  <i>Canonical fighting robot Xiaomi</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a35/a05/7df/a35a057dfc12b82a3a5ffae8dc6e0fee.png"></div><br>  <i>Variation from a mechanical set</i> <br><br>  We do not know why, but almost every child (or even not a child) has a moment when he stares for a long time at a classmate or a classmate who gathers a pack of comrades around himself, and then resolutely tries to learn how to play the guitar.  And well, if in Soviet times, your guitar is in chiffoner - a legacy of the same state or even the intentions of your grandparents.  And if not, a new and almost always terribly short-lived hobby flies at least $ 250-300, this is if everything is very, very minimal and without show off.  The solution is - ukulele Xiaomi Populele.  In general, it is a distracting and entertaining tool that is PC-friendly via USB.  The toy for $ 172.52 is easy to learn and with the help of an obvious and enjoyable application helps a beginner to master the game on the ukulele.  In general, either it will kill the hunts for stringed plucked instruments, or it will give pleasure, or it will lead to the world of music. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fee/82c/c5d/fee82cc5d0e1b254466f5659ab079b07.png"></div><br><h2>  The most important weather in the house </h2><br>  Xiaomi has a couple of new products for home climate.  The first manufacturer himself calls the hydrothermograph - a smart <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/robot-vacuum-accessories/pp_1306883.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">temperature and humidity meter</a> .  Priborchik simple and equipped with a black and white LCD screen on which you can see the temperature and humidity inside the room.  Like many other devices, the climate station can be built into the smart home system and transmit information to other devices (for example, a humidifier or air conditioner).  So at home you will always have to wait for the optimum climate. <br><div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/robot-vacuum-accessories/pp_1306883.html%3Flkid%3D10721409"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b81/4ab/66f/b814ab66ff33d93d3e0a3d215354d685.png"></a> </div><br>  A good addition would be the <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/living-appliances/pp_557543.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">Xiaomi Smart Air Quality Monitor</a> air analyzer.  All information about the state of the air is displayed on a small monitor, which means that you get rid of the smartphone, and the information goes directly to the air purifier (if you have one).  To determine the contaminants in the ambient air, a high-precision sensor is used that can pick up particles as small as 2.5 microns in size. <br><br>  A few more new Xiaomi, past which can not be passed for one reason or another: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/kitchen-appliances/pp_536470.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">Risovarka</a> - well, it's their rice cooker, and we have craftsmen. <br></li><li>  <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/scooters-and-wheels/pp_663538.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">Coolest hoverboard</a> , for which, by the way, both the steering wheels and the seats have already appeared. <br></li><li>  <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/projector-accessories/pp_660919.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">A $ 1959 projector</a> is more of a business solution, but very high quality and powerful. <br></li></ul><br>  While Xiaomi is distinguished by the speed of development and constant quality control of all products, the guys are responsible for everything that concerns the stamp of their brand.  We ourselves like the way things are going with the Chinese giant, like getting new products.  And the best part is that every three months new products accumulate for the whole review.  Is this not evidence of the company's success? <br><br>  By the way, what about Xiaomi, besides smartphones, do you have?  Share your experiences in the comments - it is interesting to share experiences. </div>
