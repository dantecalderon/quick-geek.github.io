Stereolithography is the next step. <br><br><h3>  pros </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fw/nr/n5/fwnrn5naewxr2jzuaf9avvauufg.jpeg"><br><br><ul><li>  High accuracy </li><li>  Convenient friendly interface </li><li>  The system of automatic addition and mixing of the polymer when working with native resins </li><li>  Overall reliability </li></ul><br><h3>  Minuses </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bq/g6/sv/bqg6svcc2s8n2hptewywcuulosc.jpeg"><br><br>  The disadvantages include expensive consumables.  With continued use, cartridges are consumed quickly.  It is also worth remembering that the bath is also an expendable material, it will need to be replaced after some time of intensive work. <br><br><h3>  findings </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/i-/hd/bh/i-hdbhxwe-sukvvaukgra4nwgay.jpeg"><br><br>  The benefit of using Form 2 is to save time and model accuracy.  You can create a product and print it right away, and the tolerances stereolithograph gives far less than layer-by-layer fusion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/el/d1/fb/eld1fbhpbl_kazvloqqaqhmxl8a.jpeg"><br><br>  There is no need for manual post-processing of the surface.  You do not need to order a print from a third-party organization, spend time on waiting and delivery, and this can be considerable time - this service is now in great demand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gt/zo/ce/gtzoceys5sev__dejdezfyqmftu.gif"><br><br>  Possession of such a 3D printer is more than justified when it comes to continuous professional use, but may be too expensive if the printer is used for a hobby. <br><br>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/formlabs-form-2.html">You can get Formlabs Form 2</a> and get advice on the properties of consumables for it in Top 3D Shop.  Free delivery and training is attached to the printer, and as part of the promotion - a liter of photopolymer and a discount of up to 20% on consumables for 2018. <br><br>  Want more interesting news from the world of 3D technology? <br><br>  <b>Subscribe to us in the social.</b>  <b>networks:</b> <br><br> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/top3dshop/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b25/fce/eff/b25fceeffa904b06ba0818fdef351e77.png"></a> <a href="https://vk.com/top3dshop"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c76/ee9/037/c76ee903753346c29abaa49280dfd828.png"></a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/top3dshop/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f91/396/101/f91396101d2b4579bb273636bc6283fd.png"></a> <br> <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/925/e7a/3b7/925e7a3b7e02499e833866f3b09f7674.png"></a> </div>
