The time has come to tell you more about these modules, which are produced separately for the D3xx and D7xx lines. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  What are expansion modules for? </h1><br>  At the reception in large companies — and even medium-sized — secretaries often lack buttons to switch calls to all directors, department heads, and department heads, not to mention employees in lower positions.  Lack of functional buttons can occur in call centers, when you need to constantly distribute incoming calls to dozens of operators.  And even virtual pages do not save, when, for example, 4 values ​​can be assigned to 8 physical keys. <br><br>  For such cases, Snom and offers expansion modules.  In fact, this is a separate device with a display and columns of keys on the sides, which can be programmed to your liking.  For the lines of IP phones D3xx and D7xx, modules with very original names are produced - D3 and D7.  Let's look at them in more detail. <br><br><h1>  D3 </h1><br>  As you remember, the line of phones Snom D3xx and D7xx differ only in design.  This was manifested not only in the "exterior" of expansion modules, but also in their design. <br><br>  D3 is compatible with all Snom D3xx phones. <br><br>  In the center of the module is a large monochrome display, which displays the current values ​​of the function keys, placed by columns on both sides of the display.  The keys, as in D3, two-color - glow either red or green. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cdd/d37/90a/cddd3790abf3d73a5cc90ffbd9dedfce.png" width="400"></div><br>  The display is equipped with a backlight, which automatically turns on when you pick up the phone, press a key on the module or on the phone, or when someone calls. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/045/29b/145/04529b14536253cc79b55992eba19468.png" width="400"></div><br>  If no one is calling and you are not using the phone, the backlight goes out after a few seconds.  The keys are equipped with two-color LEDs, so that one or another action / event can be indicated not only by blinking or constant luminescence, but also by color.  Absolutely all module settings are made from the phone. <br><br>  D3 is rigidly attached to the phone and makes up with it a single whole, the concavity of its panel repeats the bends of the panels of all compatible phones.  Connecting through a USB 2.0 port, the module can receive power via both a USB cable and a 5-volt power supply. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/86c/94e/7ef/86c94e7ef982925d91d0c72fede2a8a9.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/081/8aa/4be/0818aa4be4e8c0312eef8f8ef7bb4aed.png"><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/282/dd3/41a/282dd341a92170397cd474f3cfbc322e.png" width="300"></div><br>  <i>Mount to the phone.</i>  <i>There is a similar counterpart on the other side of the module itself, which allows you to connect another module to it.</i> <br><br>  The module is equipped with two USB ports, and up to three D3 can be connected to the same phone with a “train”.  That is, in addition, you can get 18 x 3 = 54 function keys.  There are no virtual pages; only one action can be assigned to each key. <br><br>  The second USB port of the last module in the chain can also be used by connecting a headset or Wi-Fi-dongle.  Please note that the power of USB “parent” phone is not enough to power two or three D3, in this case, the second module will have to connect the power supply. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c4d/cb0/fcf/c4dcb0fcf843d79475ebbe137baaa786.png" width="400"></div><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/885/e3b/aba/885e3baba02a7ac62c30995cddb11f91.png"><br><br><h1>  D7 </h1><br>  D7 is compatible with all models of the Snom D7xx range. <br><br>  This module is based on the same concept: the big screen, and on the sides of the two columns of programmable function keys - also 18 pieces.  As in D3, here each key can be assigned only one value, that is, there are no virtual pages. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/01d/ea5/78f/01dea578f3bb28629d0f47b13b975179.png" width="400"></div><br>  The front panel of the module is flat, just like the phones themselves in this line. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/819/153/f29/819153f294c25d010dfa0300ab9d4e6e.png"><br><br>  The monochrome display is also equipped with a backlight, which turns off when the phone is inactive. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f94/827/ced/f94827cede7faff03e00ffc912292f58.png" width="400"></div><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c35/03d/b36/c3503db36ad2c19c353cc357f36ef871.png" width="400"></div><br>  D7, unlike D3, is not physically attached to phones, so externally it does not look like a part of a phone, but as an external device (which is essentially what it is).  Why did the D7 not be "fastened"?  Most likely, the reason is that the Snom D7xx phones are not unified in height with each other, unlike the D3xx. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/023/d09/5dc/023d095dce3a816ea7d924661e574794.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/232/732/ac1/232732ac1abe2ed68998489689606fe9.png"><br><br>  Like all D7xx phones, the D7 module has a quick-detachable stand that gives the device a tilt angle of 46 or 28 degrees. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b07/7d5/e73/b077d5e73992d076bde71f8bcf555c9d.png"><br><br>  D7 connects to the phone via USB, and here we also have the opportunity to connect a chain of up to three modules at once.  But given their freestanding design, it will not look as harmonious as in the case of D3. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7d5/43d/b74/7d543db740a5b41542f333f78b4fca8b.png"><br><br>  The D7 has only one USB port, that is, the interface cable is “embedded” in the case.  The last port in the chain of the module can also be used with benefit by connecting a headset or Wi-Fi- "whistle". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/28a/3d2/021/28a3d202148541f4d65b64f01f2de133.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/33e/969/044/33e9690445a0026ff48fe83f11228000.png"><br><br>  The power options are the same as in D3: if one module is connected, it can be powered from USB, and if two or three, then the power supply unit should be connected to the second module. </div>
