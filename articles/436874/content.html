<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  So, on January 4 at 7:15, wiping my eyes from sleep, I discover a packet in the Telegram group from the Zabbix server that the load on the CPU has increased on one of the virtualization servers: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mb/6o/wz/mb6owzivk1hb0e_mfwe5_ycsobk.png"><a name="habracut"></a><cut></cut><br>  Having looked at the story in Zabbix, I climb to the server and look in the dmesg, where I find the following: </p><br><pre><code class="plaintext hljs">[Чт янв 3 20:05:18 2019] qla2xxx [0000:21:00.1]-015b:10: Disabling adapter.

Having a little loaded all the nodes with the help of stress-ng, it became clear that the processors of the nodes in the right side of the platform are not blown properly and the temperature of the second CPU in two nodes very quickly reaches the critical one. </p><br><p>  After trying to change the parameters of the blower in the BMC, it turned out that they do not have an action: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/q5/e-/ng/q5e-ngkv2nevpw9bz2aod-rbgum.png"></p><br><p>  Restarting the BMC also had no effect. </p><br><p>  Looking into the Sensor Readings, I saw that on one node of 53 sensors, only 4 are detected, and on the other node only 6: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dn/47/d3/dn47d3mxpac_i_gktmyjql3rn7u.png"></p><br><p>  And then, I remembered that flashing the new BIOS version and a new BMC into nodes from a month or two ago, on two nodes I did not reset the BMC configuration to the factory settings (to check one special case of settings). </p><br><p>  After resetting the BMC to the factory settings, all 53 sensors again showed up, fan speed control started up again, and the processors stopped warming up. </p><br><p>  The fact that the reason for unloading the QLogic driver is overheating of the processor is not certain, but I did not find any close correlations. </p><br><p>  Findings: </p><br><ol><li>  after the BMC firmware, even if everything works fine at first glance, it is still worth resetting the settings to the factory settings; </li><li>  Of course, the temperature and error messages of the kernel should be put under monitoring, and this is natural in the plans, but not all at once. </li></ol></div>
