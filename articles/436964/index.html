On February 28, there will be more such projects.  We will start ‚ÄúRostelecom.  DataTalks ‚Äù- a series of lectures on data engineering and data management from seven leading companies in this field.  All the details are in this post. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/07f/66c/c1e/07f66cc1e70c6876a87946166b91835a.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We will conduct lectures offline, in a large conference room at the Exhibition of Economic Achievements (Moscow, 119 Mira Avenue, p. 63; Art-Tehnograd building), on Mondays and Thursdays from 19 to 22 hours.

On February 7, from 19:30 at the DI Telegraph (Moscow, Tverskaya, 7), we are conducting a mitap together with ArenaData.  Here is the program: <br><br>  <b>19: 30‚Äì20: 00.</b>  <b>‚ÄúMigration from Greenplum 4 to Greenplum 5 and a look towards open source‚Äù</b> <br>  <i>Boris Emelyanov, Rostelecom</i> <br><br>  We migrated some of our environments from Greenplum 4 to Greenplum 5.

The number of used data applications is growing, the landscape is becoming more and more complex.  The pure on-premise is replaced by a mix of iron, public and private clouds.  Arenadata.io has developed Cluster Manager, a single modular, free open-source data-services and infrastructure management platform.

With its help, small and large companies can analyze the ROI of their advertising channels and understand what is profitable and what is not. <br>  Under the hood, Alytics implements all the components of a modern classical analytics system: from data connectors to delivery systems, storage, processing and visualization.  Due to a combination of ANSI SQL, MPP and In-memory, the latest version of Alytics includes a lot of interesting things - complex analytics for session chains, configurable interactive BI dashboards with a millisecond response, second reporting on deep drillings based on non-aggregated data.  Without the "classic" "Hadup, s3, presto, druids, verticals, pentahi" and the like.  In the paradigm of Opensource and full SQL.  At the mitap, the overall solution architecture will be reviewed, as well as individual components.

We put on fire (performance tests) <br>  4. Cooking (strapping and architecture on top of Kafka) <br><br>  <b>22: 00‚Äì22: 30.</b>  <b>Free communication</b> <br><br>  Registration for the mitap - by <a href="https://www.meetup.com/ru-RU/Scale-out-databases-and-engines/events/257153368/">reference</a> .
