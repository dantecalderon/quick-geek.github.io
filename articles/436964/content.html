According to the results of the first cycle of lectures, we are planning to make courses on narrower specializations - for business analysts, developers, system analysts.  The next, third level is an even narrower specialization.  If a person, for example, has always dreamed of introducing MDM systems, then according to the results of the third stage he will become quite competent in this topic. <br><br><h2>  Mitap February 7 </h2><br>  For those who leafed through to the end - a bonus.
