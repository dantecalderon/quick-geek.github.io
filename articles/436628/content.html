<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h3>  Reminder </h3><br>  Hi, Habr!  I bring to your attention one more translation of my new article from a <a href="https://medium.com/%40alexeybnk/improving-q-learning-agent-trading-stock-by-adding-recurrency-and-reward-shaping-b9e0ee095c8b">medium</a> . <br><br>  Last time (the <a href="https://medium.com/%40alexeybnk/can-reinforcement-learning-trade-stock-implementation-in-r-8cd54d13165c">first article</a> ) ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/433182/">Habr</a> ) we created an agent on Q-Learning technology, who makes deals on simulated and real stock exchange time series and tried to check whether this task area is suitable for reinforcement learning. <br><br>  This time we will add an LSTM layer to account for the time dependencies inside the trajectory and do reward shaping based on the presentations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3c4/e75/63f/3c4e7563f3cf1e6f158dc0605fe80a78.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I recall that to test the concept, we used the following synthetic data: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fb2/f15/3b6/fb2f153b6c4e14ff1dc19d61a524f5e8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Synthetic data: sine with white noise. <br><br>  The sine function was the first starting point.  Two curves mimic the purchase and sale price of an asset, where the spread is the minimum transaction value. <br><br>  However, this time we want to complicate this simple task by extending the credit assignment path: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/561/c36/928/561c369289780642ca5b22c852d06a8b.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Synthetic data: sine with white noise. <br><br>  The sine phase has been doubled. <br><br>  This means that the sparse rewards that we use should spread along longer paths.  In addition, we significantly reduce the likelihood of receiving a positive remuneration, since the agent had to perform a sequence of correct actions 2 times longer in order to overcome transaction costs.  Both factors significantly complicate the task for RL even in such simple conditions as a sinusoid. <br><br>  In addition, we recall that we used this neural network architecture: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3dc/20c/e1e/3dc20ce1eedec47b871ef59ab7911ef3.png" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  What was added and why </h3><br><h4>  Lstm </h4><br>  First of all, we wanted to give the agent more insight into the dynamics of changes within the trajectory.  Simply put, the agent should better understand his own behavior: what he did right now and some time in the past, and how the distribution of state-actions, as well as the awards received, developed.  Using a recurrent layer can solve this particular problem.  Welcome the new architecture used to launch a new set of experiments: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/09c/b6e/b0d/09cb6eb0d07dd7808657aaeaec5c5c7c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Please note that I have slightly improved the description.  The only difference from the old NN is the first hidden layer of LSTM instead of the fully bound one. <br><br>  Please note that with LSTM in work, we need to change the sample of examples of experience reproduction for training: now we need transition sequences instead of individual examples.  This is how it works (this is one of the algorithms).  We used point sampling earlier: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/51a/d0b/412/51ad0b4125f0d084e19e81d81a6b10a4.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Dummy buffer playback. <br><br>  We use this scheme with LSTM: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1ee/fb7/537/1eefb75379450cf86c03d5cf30e93dd9.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Now the sequences are selected (whose length we define empirically). <br><br>  Both before and now the sample is regulated by a priority algorithm based on errors of temporal and temporal training. <br><br>  The recurrent level of LSTM allows the direct dissemination of information from the time series to intercept an additional signal hidden in past logs.  Our time series is a two-dimensional tensor with size: the length of a sequence on the representations of our state-action. <br><br><h4>  Presentations </h4><br>  The award-winning engineering, Potential Based Reward Shaping (PBRS) - based on potential, is a powerful tool that allows you to increase speed, stability and not violate the optimality of the policy search process to solve our environment.  I recommend reading at least this original document on the subject: <br><br>  <a href="">people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/papers/ml99-shaping.ps</a> <br><br>  The potential determines how well our current state is relative to the target state we want to enter.  Sketchy look at how this works: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1b1/6f3/85d/1b16f385dedd440d6bd15f74b76f304d.png" alt="image"><br><br>  There are options and difficulties that you might understand after trial and error, and we omit these details, leaving you to do your homework. <br><br>  Another thing worth mentioning is that PBRS can be justified with the help of presentations, which are a form of expert (or simulated) knowledge of the <i>almost</i> optimal behavior of the agent in the environment.  There is a way to find such presentations for our task using optimization schemes.  Omit the search details. <br><br>  The potential reward takes the following form (equation 1): <br><br>  r '= r + gamma * F (s') - F (s) <br><br>  where F means the potential of the state, and r is the initial reward, gamma is the discounting factor (0: 1). <br><br>  <b>With these thoughts, we turn to coding.</b> <br><br>  Implementation in R <br>  Here is the neural network code based on the Keras API: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Code</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><pre><code class="python hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment"># configure critic NN — — — — — — library('keras') library('R6') state_names_length &lt;- 12 #

The speed is about 4–5 times higher than without presentations.  Stability is wonderful. <br><br>  When it comes to using LSTM, 4 cells performed better than 2 cells.  The 2-cell LSTM performed better than the non-LSTM version (however, this may be an illusion of a single experiment). <br><br><h3>  Final words </h3><br>  We have witnessed that recurrence and capacity-based reward helps.  I especially liked how PBRS showed itself so highly. <br><br>  Do not believe anyone who makes me say that it is easy to create an RL agent who fits well, as this is a lie.  Each new component added to the system makes it potentially less stable and requires a lot of configuration and debugging. <br><br>  Nevertheless, there is clear evidence that the solution to the problem can be improved simply by improving the methods used (the data remained intact).  It is a fact that for any task a certain range of parameters works better than others.  With this in mind, you embark on the path of successful training with reinforcements. <br><br>  <b>Thank.</b> </div>
