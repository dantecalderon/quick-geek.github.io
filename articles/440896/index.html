Thus, at the Metalworking-2018 exhibition, additive technologies were first presented on a separate site;  Digital production was the main theme of the Innoprom International Industrial Exhibition, which took place in Yekaterinburg in July 2018. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For engineering, as one of the key sectors of the Russian economy, the development of new equipment and the use of advanced solutions are extremely important.  3D technology fully meets these needs.  While improving, they provide more and more efficiency, allowing enterprises to reduce and simplify the technological process and optimize production costs. <br><br>  For example, the creation of a prototype on a 3D printer will not take months, as in traditional production, but only a few hours.  The time spent on finalizing the design and launching the product into mass production is significantly saved, and, accordingly, the cost of the entire project is reduced.  Thanks to the use of <a href="http://blog.iqb-tech.ru/3d-scanning-kazan-2017">3D scanners</a> and software for reverse engineering and geometry control, time and money are reduced by an average of 1.5 times. <br><br><h3>  The benefits of 3D printing </h3><br><ul><li>  Production of parts with the <a href="http://blog.iqb-tech.ru/3d-metal-fabrication">geometry of any complexity</a> , which leaves far behind the possibilities of traditional methods. </li><li>  Optimization of product parameters such as accuracy and strength, as well as weight reduction due to the creation of super-thin walls, internal channels and bionic structures. </li><li>  Acceleration and reduction of the cost of the production process: there is no need to use expensive tooling, and in some cases - machining. </li><li>  Improving the profitability of manufacturing small-scale and customized products. </li><li>  Reducing risks and design errors, including due to the <a href="http://blog.iqb-tech.ru/geometry-topology-optimization">possibility of changing the design</a> in the later stages of design. </li><li>  Management of physical and mechanical properties of the product through the use of high-tech materials. </li></ul><br><h3>  Problems solved in mechanical engineering using 3D printing </h3><br><ol><li>  Functional testing and prototyping. </li><li>  Production of technical prototypes for the design of products. </li><li>  Conducting technological experiments. </li><li>  Checking products for ergonomics. </li><li>  Creation of master models for casting, including casting and burning out models. </li><li>  Quick tooling. </li><li>  Production of forming elements of molds for casting thermoplastics and light materials. </li><li>  Production of functional parts for a variety of units and components. </li><li>  Creating complex structures, including solid ones, which were previously assembled from many elements. </li></ol><br><h3>  3D printing technologies for engineering enterprises </h3><br><ul><li>  Layer-by-layer welding (FDM). </li><li>  Full-color inkjet (CJP). </li><li>  Multi-jet printing (MJP). </li><li>  Laser stereolithography (SLA). </li><li>  Selective laser melting (SLM). </li><li>  Selective laser sintering (SLS). </li></ul><br><h3>  Benefits of 3D scanning </h3><br><ul><li>  High speed scanning devices. </li><li>  Accurate measurements in actual operating conditions. </li><li>  Ability to integrate into <a href="http://blog.iqb-tech.ru/automated-scanning-system">automated production systems</a> . </li><li>  Measurement of any objects, regardless of size, complexity, material or color. </li><li>  Simplicity and convenience in work. </li></ul><br><h3>  Tasks solved with the help of 3D-scanners and specialized software </h3><br><ol><li>  <a href="http://blog.iqb-tech.ru/reverse-engineering-3d-scanning">Reverse engineering</a> (reverse engineering), getting ready drawings. </li><li>  Metrological control of products in the manufacturing process, analysis of wear. </li><li>  Control of geometry, deformation and damage to products. </li><li>  <a href="http://blog.iqb-tech.ru/3d-scanning-quality-control">Quality control</a> . </li><li>  Digital archiving. </li></ol><br><h3>  7 success stories </h3><br>  <b>Hydraulic valve block</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ei/ck/hb/eickhbxey_dsruwqef2i_eos9ee.jpeg"><br><br>  <i>Final valve block CAD file ready for 3D printing</i> <br><br>  The design of the new hydraulic valve block developed by VTT and Nurmi Cylinders has been optimized using selective laser melting technology (SLM), which has significantly saved weight, volume and material.  As a result, a product was created, the weight of which is 66% less than the original model.  Thanks to an innovative design, it was possible to optimize the flow of fluid through the internal channels and solve the leakage problem. <br><br>  <a href="http://blog.iqb-tech.ru/slm-vtt-case">The project in detail</a> <br><br>  <b>Liquid mixer with gas</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/a1/fe/fx/a1fefxvbeut58ypnas1vuu6bycw.jpeg"><br><br>  <i>The scheme of all-metal mixer, created by SLM-technology.</i>  <i>Bottom right: the original model, consisting of 12 elements</i> <br><br>  Jurec Rapid Prototyping Center, using the equipment of SLM Solutions, completed a project to improve the liquid-gas mixer.  Initially, the device was assembled from 12 parts, including 3 large elements - the first and second flange case connections and the insertion of the mixer.  Selective laser melting made it possible to create a single case, reducing the number of parts from 12 to one.  There is no need to use several <a href="http://blog.iqb-tech.ru/metal-powders-slm-solutions">metals</a> and flange connections: inside the all-metal body, the thread is simply cut, due to which the mixer weight decreased from 1.3 kg to 50 g. Production time was reduced twice.  Finally, the financial cost of production decreased by 73%. <br><br>  <a href="http://blog.iqb-tech.ru/3d-metal-fabrication">More practical examples of 3D metal printing</a> <br><br>  <b>Splitter sonar antenna</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/61/zc/y2/61zcy2_waizyivsl4kbinuz4ohy.jpeg"><br><br>  <i>Left: a two-part master form printed on a 3D printer.</i>  <i>Right: removing the finished part from the silicone mold</i> <br><br>  Concern Oceanpribor OJSC (St. Petersburg) produces communication systems for the Russian Navy, including equipment with a large number of small elements, for example, a splitter is one of the main components of a new hydroacoustic antenna.  For rapid prototyping in the manufacture of molded parts, the concern uses <a href="http://blog.iqb-tech.ru/3d-systems-professional-series">a 3D</a> Pro <a href="http://blog.iqb-tech.ru/3d-systems-professional-series">Systems 3D</a> ProJet 660Pro <a href="http://blog.iqb-tech.ru/3d-systems-professional-series">3D printer</a> , which uses CJP technology.  A mold is grown on a 3D printer, which is then poured with silicone.  Any other material can be poured into the silicone mold, in this case it is polyurethane.  As a result, the company receives a kind of form for the forms - not just a prototype, but a prototype, ready for use.  Implementation of the project using standard methods would have required several months, but thanks to a 3D printer, the antenna creation period was reduced to three weeks. <br><br>  <a href="http://blog.iqb-tech.ru/case-okeanpribor">The project in detail</a> <br><br>  <b>Gas Turbine Engine Components</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dp/gb/0u/dpgb0utmjosnbjulziytdg1zojo.jpeg"><br><br>  <i>3D waxed wax model and finished product</i> <br><br>  American company Turbine Technologies, Ltd.  developed a modification of internal combustion engines, which are installed high-pressure turbines.  The company has acquired a 3D Systems ProJet MJP 3600W printer for 3D printing of wax models and receives the finished casting within 3-4 days.  Wax models are now manufactured directly from 3D CAD models, and Turbine Technologies' foundry produces prototype components for gas turbine engines with greater accuracy and lower costs. <br><br>  <a href="http://blog.iqb-tech.ru/additive-technologies-lost-wax">More practical examples of using 3D printing in investment casting</a> <br><br>  <b>Components and components for aircraft manufacturing</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uv/m-/d5/uvm-d5ywbg2bcmr6jmpfbuvy9pe.jpeg"><br><br>  <i>3D printing with QuickCast photopolymers saves time and money because it eliminates the need for costly equipment</i> <br><br>  Vaupell develops manufacturing solutions for foundries that carry out aerospace and defense orders.  Thanks to the 3D Systems ProX 800 stereo lithographic 3D printer, the company was able to drastically improve production efficiency.  The printer has a special mode of printing by photopolymer - <a href="http://blog.iqb-tech.ru/quickcast-history">QuickCast</a> , in which the thin-walled outer shell of the part is reproduced, and the voids inside the part are filled with a cellular structure.  QuickCast models replace traditional foundry models and do not require expensive tooling.  Thus, the company has reduced the cost of foundry models by 95%. <br><br>  <a href="http://blog.iqb-tech.ru/vaupell-3d-systems-case">Watch the video</a> <br><br>  <b>Control of the geometry of the pump casing</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fj/oz/09/fjoz09jup1umz_ge5whqgatcwhq.jpeg"><br><br>  <i>Lining geometry deviation map</i> <br><br>  IQB Technologies completed a project that included 3D scanning of the pump casing after machining and a separate 3D scanning of the casing with lining to control the coating thickness.  At the first stage, the product was digitized by the Creaform HandySCAN 700 hand-held 3D scanner, and then a high-poly 3D model of the pump casing was obtained.  Then the specialists made a control of the deviations of the geometry in <a href="http://blog.iqb-tech.ru/3d-software">Geomagic Control X</a> software.  Identified deviations in the surface of the coating create additional pressure on the body, therefore, reduce its service life.  The project was completed in just 4 hours. <br><br>  <a href="http://blog.iqb-tech.ru/3d-scanning-quality-control">More practical examples of quality control with a 3D scanner</a> <br><br>  <b>Reverse engineering impeller turbine</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/re/aw/xq/reawxqjosnar6muthzodeowdyku.jpeg"><br><br>  <i>3D scanning of the turbine wheel for subsequent reverse engineering</i> <br><br>  Dependable Industries (a manufacturer of casting models and tools from Vancouver) approached entrepreneur Matthew Percival of 3D Rev Eng to assist in the reverse design of impeller casting of a radial-axial hydraulic turbine.  The program for reverse engineering <a href="http://blog.iqb-tech.ru/geomagic-design-x">Geomagic Design X</a> allows for several hours to create such models with complex shapes, for the manufacture of which using traditional technologies would take several weeks.  Thanks to Geomagic Design X, the time for reverse engineering has been reduced by 50%, and production costs have been reduced by 48%. <br><br>  <a href="http://blog.iqb-tech.ru/geomagic-design-x-impeller">The project in detail</a> <br><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  3D technology also has constraints.  This is the high cost of equipment and materials, and insufficient knowledge, and lack of specialists, and difficulties with integration into traditional technological chains.  Additive methods for today cannot supplant or replace classical technologies, but they prove economic benefits in prototyping and small-scale production and become the only possible solution in the manufacture of complex parts of small size.  Ultimately, the use of three-dimensional printing technology, scanning and modeling allows you to quickly bring new products to the market, and thus increases the competitiveness of machine-building enterprises. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/440896/">https://habr.com/ru/post/440896/</a></p>
