Let me remind you that it all started with the fact that some Reddit users <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/pochtoy/blog/296405/">found</a> that the same Apple smartphone models have different processor clock speeds.  And the models are absolutely identical, the difference is only in the service life.  That is, older phones are slower. <br><br>  As it turned out (and the corporation recognized it), in new versions of iOS there is an algorithm that slows down the speed of the device, depending on the state of its battery.  And not only the charge and voltage of the battery, but also the ambient temperature is taken into account.  However, in this case, the company slows down the phones so that they do not turn off unintentionally. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The problem lies in the update for the iOS operating system, which came out nearly a year ago.  This update was designed to solve problems with phone batteries.  According to company representatives, the older the battery, the worse it holds a charge, especially at low temperatures.  And if the processor continues to operate at full capacity, then the battery simply cannot provide as much energy as necessary.  As a result, the phone turns off. <br><br>  The decision to force a slowdown of the company's phones was made in 2016.  The slowdown algorithm became relevant with the iOS 10.2.1 update, which appeared back in January 2017.  In order to remove the slowdown, there is only one solution - battery replacement.  This helps speed up the phone, and also doubles the benchmark results.  But replacing the battery in the official service of the corporation costs about $ 80, which is a very good item of income for the corporation. <br><br>  It is possible that Apple, slowing down the phone, was also hoping that sooner or later the user would get tired of this situation and he would follow the new smartphone.  After the situation became known, many Apple fans have condemned the company's actions.  Moreover, individual users began to file lawsuits, which is becoming more and more.  Currently, only 59 individual lawsuits have been filed in the United States.  This is relatively little, but it is worth remembering that not everyone wants to go to court and spend their time and money on litigation. <br><br>  In addition to the United States, Apple receives lawsuits in other countries, a total of six.  Trying to sue the corporation in Russia.  The first claims began to appear in December last year, just after all this became known and the situation with slow phones became public.  According to representatives of the media, the corporation in order to avoid this situation, it was necessary only to talk about their intentions.  Then, if there were dissatisfied users, it would be only a detriment to the popularity of the company's products, and then, it would obviously not become too great. <br><br>  After all this, the corporation lowered the cost of replacing the iPhone 6 phone battery to $ 29.  Starting with the operating system version 11.3, users will be able to obtain detailed information about the battery status of their device.  This feature is now available in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/02/06/ios-11-3-beta-2-battery-health/">OS beta</a> . <br><br>  The corporation itself declares that it didn’t hold anything bad in its thoughts: “The main and most important thing is that we never did anything with the intention to shorten the life of our devices - and we will not do anything like that.  Also, we didn’t do anything to encourage the user to leave his old device and purchase a new one.  Our goal has always been to create products, devices that users will like, and therefore we are trying to ensure the maximum service life for iPhones. ” <br><br>  The other day it became known that the Tverskoy Court of Moscow did not immediately accept five lawsuits filed by Russian iPhone owners against Apple.  “Today, by a judge’s decision, three claimants were returned to the applicants, two more claims were returned by a court decision of February 19,” the <a href="http://www.interfax.ru/moscow/601638">interfax told</a> Interfax on Tuesday.  court press secretary Svetlana Maximova.  According to the judge, the claims were rejected due to deficiencies in the design (as a rule, this is the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/297485/">absence of the price of the claim</a> ).  In early January of this year, the same Interfax <a href="http://www.interfax.ru/russia/595700">reported</a> on the preparation of hundreds of lawsuits against Apple by Russian users.  Claims, as reported, will be filed both at the location of the defendant and at the place of registration of the plaintiffs. </div>
