These are full analogues of existing CPUs, but with limited functionality.  Processors without integrated graphics Intel UHD Graphics 630 iGPU are indicated by the suffix 'F' (as well as chips with an integrated fabric matrix, also with the index 'F', so you should not confuse them). <br><br>  Now, Intel has announced wholesale prices for new CPUs for manufacturers (in batches of 1000 pieces). <br><br>  AnadTech <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/13865/intels-graphics-free-chips-are-also-savings-free-same-price-fewer-features">drew attention</a> to a strange pricing model: processors without graphics are sold at <b>exactly the same price</b> as with the integrated GPU.  The manufacturer can be understood.  Apparently, the cost of the processors is the same: the version “without integrated graphics” means that the GPU is actually there, just that it is disabled. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But for the buyer, the situation looks strange.  Especially in a similar situation, when the processor disconnects a part of the cores at the hardware level, it is sold cheaper.  The success of AMD Ryzen shows that there is a high demand for processors without integrated graphics, but usually this version is sold at a lower price.  Intel is different. <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td colspan="9" align="center">  9th generation Intel CPU </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>  Core </td><td>  Basic <br>  frequency </td><td>  Turbo </td><td>  Igp </td><td>  Igp <br>  frequency </td><td>  DDR4 </td><td>  Tdp </td><td>  Price <br>  (opt.) </td></tr><tr><td>  i9-9900K </td><td>  8/16 </td><td>  3.6 GHz </td><td>  5.0 GHz </td><td>  UHD 630 </td><td>  1200 </td><td>  2666 </td><td>  95 W </td><td>  $ 488 </td></tr><tr><td>  i9-9900KF </td><td>  <strong>8/16</strong> </td><td>  <strong>3.6 GHz</strong> </td><td>  <strong>5.0 GHz</strong> </td><td>  <strong>-</strong> </td><td>  <strong>-</strong> </td><td>  <strong>2666</strong> </td><td>  <strong>95 W</strong> </td><td>  <strong>$ 488</strong> </td></tr><tr><td>  i7-9700K </td><td>  8/8 </td><td>  3.6 GHz </td><td>  4.9 GHz </td><td>  UHD 630 </td><td>  1200 </td><td>  2666 </td><td>  95 W </td><td>  $ 374 </td></tr><tr><td>  i7-9700KF </td><td>  <strong>8/8</strong> </td><td>  <strong>3.6 GHz</strong> </td><td>  <strong>4.9 GHz</strong> </td><td>  <strong>-</strong> </td><td>  <strong>-</strong> </td><td>  <strong>2666</strong> </td><td>  <strong>95 W</strong> </td><td>  <strong>$ 374</strong> </td></tr><tr><td>  i5-9600K </td><td>  6/6 </td><td>  3.7 GHz </td><td>  4.6 GHz </td><td>  UHD 630 </td><td>  1150 </td><td>  2666 </td><td>  95 W </td><td>  $ 262 </td></tr><tr><td>  i5-9600KF </td><td>  <strong>6/6</strong> </td><td>  <strong>3.7 GHz</strong> </td><td>  <strong>4.6 GHz</strong> </td><td>  <strong>-</strong> </td><td>  <strong>-</strong> </td><td>  <strong>2666</strong> </td><td>  <strong>95 W</strong> </td><td>  <strong>$ 262</strong> </td></tr><tr><td>  i5-9400 </td><td>  6/6 </td><td>  2.9 GHz </td><td>  4.1 GHz </td><td>  UHD 630 </td><td>  1050 </td><td>  2666 </td><td>  65 W </td><td>  $ 182 </td></tr><tr><td>  i5-9400F </td><td>  <strong>6/6</strong> </td><td>  <strong>2.9 GHz</strong> </td><td>  <strong>4.1 GHz</strong> </td><td>  <strong>-</strong> </td><td>  <strong>-</strong> </td><td>  <strong>2666</strong> </td><td>  <strong>65 W</strong> </td><td>  <strong>$ 182</strong> </td></tr><tr><td>  i3-9350KF </td><td>  <strong>4/4</strong> </td><td>  <strong>4.0 GHz</strong> </td><td>  <strong>4.6 GHz</strong> </td><td>  <strong>-</strong> </td><td>  <strong>-</strong> </td><td>  <strong>2400</strong> </td><td>  <strong>91 W</strong> </td><td>  <strong>$ 173</strong> </td></tr><tr><td colspan="9" align="center">  8th generation Intel CPU </td></tr><tr><td>  i3-8350K </td><td>  4/4 </td><td>  4.0 GHz </td><td>  - </td><td>  UHD 630 </td><td>  1150 </td><td>  2400 </td><td>  91 W </td><td>  $ 168 </td></tr><tr><td>  i3-8100 </td><td>  4/4 </td><td>  3.6 GHz </td><td>  - </td><td>  UHD 630 </td><td>  1100 </td><td>  2400 </td><td>  65 W </td><td>  $ 117 </td></tr><tr><td>  i3-8100F </td><td>  <strong>4/4</strong> </td><td>  <strong>3.6 GHz</strong> </td><td>  <strong>-</strong> </td><td>  <strong>-</strong> </td><td>  <strong>-</strong> </td><td>  <strong>2400</strong> </td><td>  <strong>65 W</strong> </td><td>  <strong>$ 117</strong> </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  The only processor in the list without a full-fledged “pair” is the overclocked Core i3-9350KF at a wholesale price of $ 173, which is a few dollars more than the processor of the previous generation i3-8350K ($ 168).  Unlike the ancestor, the Core i3-9350KF supports turbo mode. <br><br>  The retail price on the market is usually 10–20% higher than the wholesale price, but it strongly depends on the total number of processors released.  It is likely that in the retail version of the trimmed versions will still be a little cheaper. <br><br>  Like the full-fledged versions, the analogues with the 'F' index are produced by a 14 nm process technology.  With their help, Intel is trying to deal with the shortage of 14 nm processors, which is now being felt on the market - this version is <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-f-series-9th-gen-processors-price,38434.html">expressed</a> by <i>Tom's Hardware</i> : “The incredibly complex chip manufacturing process is not perfect, therefore many processors leave the production line with defects.  If a defect is found in the kernel, Intel can simply disable the kernels and sell the processor as a low-level model.  Therefore, it is clear that the sale of chips with disabled integrated graphics will allow Intel to sell chips with defects in the GPU. ” <br><br>  <i>Tom's Hardware</i> confirms that the new Intel processors are not physically different from the normal ones, and disabling the GPU does not provide any performance benefits, such as overclocking.  Their only advantage is that they can be on sale when there are no high-grade chips.  But the drawback is obvious - in case of failure of the main graphics card, the computer will no longer be able to switch to the integrated GPU. <br><br>  The shortage of CPU is largely due to the record demand for Intel processors, for the same reason prices continue to rise.  Retailers consider several factors, while affordability is a key factor in setting the final retail price.  Thus, F-series processors can theoretically be sold at lower prices if the equivalent with integrated graphics is really harder to get.  But by setting the wholesale price at the same level, Intel (perhaps unintentionally) gives retailers permission to sell cropped models at the same prices as the processors that are currently in short supply, writes <i>Tom's Hardware</i> . </div>
