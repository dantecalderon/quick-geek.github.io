<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Having decided to try my hand at a foreign market, I started sending resumes to various offices.  Not even for the purpose of finding a job, but simply for expanding the horizons.  The choice fell on the job "Java Developer".  I have no industrial experience with the language, only personal experience, certificates from the Oracle Certification Center, books, etc.  Honestly, at the last job in one and a half years I didn’t write anything except for the “odds” and “ifs” (but this is a completely different story), so I decided why not. <br><br>  Skipping the history of the search and conversations with employers, move on to the point.  One company K from city G wrote that they were interested in having an interview with me after I solved the problem. <br><br>  After I decided and sent them the decision, K replied that after the review code they decided not to review my application more.  It was a blow to my self-esteem.  Of course, I understand that the language is new, and in general anything happens, but I hoped for at least a review of my decision.  Plus, the task is really simple ... I hope you will be interested in the task. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Below is the original text of the problem. <br><br><h3>  RESTAURANT EXERCISE </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9c1/ba4/248/9c1ba42485d6f311c1a96f20ed8aaf25.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  RESTAURANT EXERCISE (please use JAVA 7 syntax) <br><br>  Your table has a set of tables of different sizes: each table can accommodate 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 persons.  Clients arrive alone or in groups, up to 6 persons.  It is therefore a group that can accommodate them all.  There is a table where you can wait in the queue. <br><br>  Once seated, you can’t make it. <br><br>  In the case of a group of children, it’s not a problem.  For example, if there is a table for two, there is a table for two people. <br><br>  There are no chairs for people to use. , even if the table is bigger than the size of the group. <br><br>  It’s not worth it. <br><br>  Please complete the RestManager class with the data methods.  You will be able to modify them. <br><br><pre><code class="java hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span></span> <span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span></span></span><span class="hljs-class"> </span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-title">Table</span></span></span><span class="hljs-class"> </span></span>{ <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">final</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">int</span></span> size; <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">// number of chairs } public class ClientsGroup { public final int size; // number of clients } public class RestManager { public RestManager (List&lt;Table&gt; tables) { // TODO } // new client(s) show up public void onArrive (ClientsGroup group) { // TODO } // client(s) leave, either served or simply abandoning the queue public void onLeave (ClientsGroup group) { // TODO } // return table where a given client group is seated, // or null if it is still queuing or has already left public Table lookup (ClientsGroup group) { // TODO } }</span></span></code> </pre> <br><h3>  Task analysis </h3><br>  After analyzing the task, it seemed to me and it seems now, well, there is nothing absolutely complicated.  However, I immediately want to draw attention to two points that confused me a little. <br><br><ol><li>  "If you’re looking for a group of children, it’s not worth it." </li><li>  RestManager class structure </li></ol><br>  Regarding the first paragraph, the fact is that our distribution system works according to the above rules, so the situation described in paragraph 1 cannot be avoided.  The only thing that I wrote in the reply letter, you can add a delay before issuing a free table.  Let's say a group of 3 people comes to a restaurant.  At the moment there is a single table on the 6th.  By condition, we are obliged to provide them with a table (you must always have a seat at your empty table ... even if there is a table).  But if this is not done immediately, but after 5 minutes. During this time there is a chance, albeit a small one, that a place or table with less dimension will be freed.  But it looks frivolous of course. <br>  On the second point, at least IMHO, the public Table lookup method is not in its class.  We can get the table as a getter from a client who, according to ideas, should keep a link to the table. <br><br>  In general, I highlighted two main points: <br><br><ol><li>  It is necessary to sort the tables in the correct order.  The logic of finding the right table is simply transferred to sorting.  The first table that can accommodate a group of customers and will be necessary. </li><li>  Only two events necessitate a table search for a client or a client for a table.  This is the arrival of a new customer and after the group left the table accordingly. </li></ol><br>  Actually, the whole task comes down to the two points above.  By the way, the queue collection is useless.  The queue is a queue, but by condition any of the queues can be served, depending on the available seats and the size of the group, and as a result, we will not use the methods related to the queue. <br><br>  I leave the link to git with the solution: <a href="https://github.com/PetrShchukin/Restaurant">RestaurantTask</a> </div>
