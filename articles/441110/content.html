He said that the threat exists, it is very real. <br><br>  As for the disconnection, then, according to the president, it will be problematic for everyone, including foreign partners.  “I can’t say for our partners what is on their minds, I think that it will cause them enormous damage and damage,” Putin said.  "They sit there, it is their invention, and everyone listens, sees and reads what you say, and accumulates this information, and they will not do so." <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Before disconnecting Russia from the Internet, Vladimir Putin is sure that the initiators of such a process "will think a hundred times."  “But theoretically everything is possible, so we should create such segments that do not depend on anyone,” the president is convinced. <br><br>  Russia, according to Putin, does not plan to disconnect from the global Internet, but it is worth investing in the development of digital sovereignty: countries in particular. " <br><br>  The draft law on “sovereign runet” was adopted in the first reading on February 12.  The amendments suggest the creation of an infrastructure in the Russian Federation, which ensures the efficiency of Russian Internet resources in case of impossibility to connect to foreign servers.  It is planned to allocate 20 billion rubles for the implementation of this project.  The initiative is opposed by the Accounts Chamber and the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. <br><br><blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jy/sd/rr/jysdrr7tqgfjt50wtcshw89ctho.png" align="left"><h3>  Minute of care from UFO </h3><br>  This material could cause contradictory feelings, so before writing a comment, refresh something important in your memory: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How to write a comment and survive</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  Do not write abusive comments, do not go to the person. </li><li>  Refrain from using obscene language and toxic behavior (even in a veiled form). </li><li>  To report comments that violate the rules of the site, use the "Report" button (if available) or <a href="https://habr.com/feedback/%3Ftype%3D4">a feedback form</a> . </li></ul><br>  What to do if: <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/karma/">minus karma</a> |  <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/sandbox/">blocked account</a> <br><br>  → <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/other/">Code of authors Habra</a> and <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/other/">habraetiket</a> <br>  → <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/rules/">Full site rules</a> </div></div></blockquote></div>
