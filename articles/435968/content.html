<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The review will be useful for those who are engaged in physical robots and for whom arduino has become insufficient, as well as for people who would like to implement any of the functions of perception of the surrounding world in their robots or devices. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l2/_w/gz/l2_wgzgmlywiheglhz833yfax5s.png" alt="Misty Robot from Misty Robotics presented at CES" width="300"></div><a name="habracut"></a>  <i>Misty Robot from Misty Robotics presented at CES</i> <br><br>  Depending on the purpose of the robot, it needs to solve various tasks.  It happens that a controller and, for example, the simplest sensors are enough to solve them.  However, it is sometimes necessary that the robot could perform tasks not according to rigidly fixed coordinates, but depending on the state of the surrounding space or work area.  Then it becomes necessary to use more complex sensors, such as cameras or lidars, and use special algorithms to process incoming information. <br><br><h2>  Vision and understanding </h2><br>  To see and understand what is seen is the first function that can come to mind. <br><br><h3>  Object Detection </h3><br>  Allows you to find in the field of vision objects of a given type. <br><br>  <a href="https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet">Algorithm Example</a> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/de8/c6a/146/de8c6a14602db06b18a7e91b532953f1.jpg" alt="Work example" width="600"></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Video</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VOC3huqHrss" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br><h3>  Object Tracking </h3><br>  Allows you to track the movement of an object or objects in the field of vision. <br><br>  <a href="https://github.com/nwojke/deep_sort">Algorithm Example</a> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cv/4b/oq/cv4boq7i5d4sek1tl79ogpdgukq.jpeg" alt="Work example" width="600"></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Video</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SKXk6uB8348" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br><h3>  Segmentation </h3><br>  Allows pixel-by-pixel determination of the contents of the vision area. <br><br>  <a href="https://github.com/toimcio/SegNet-tensorflow">Algorithm Example</a> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b57/bb0/616/b57bb0616d8a221640149a7bd10c3f62.jpg" alt="Work example" width="600"></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Video</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CxanE_W46ts" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br><h3>  Depth estimate </h3><br>  Allows you to identify obstacles in the path and distance to them using computer vision. <br><br>  An example of the algorithm <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pb/6s/et/pb6setebu-a6wcr5jfgrbdsnjn4.jpeg" alt="Work example" width="600"></div><br>  <a href="https://github.com/mrharicot/monodepth">An example of an algorithm for a conventional camera</a> <br>  <a href="https://github.com/AlexJinlei/Stereo_Vision_Camera">An example algorithm for a stereo camera</a> <br><br>  If your robot's working conditions allow you to use Depth cameras with active IR backlighting, for example, such as Intel Realsense, then you can use the <a href="https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/releases">proprietary SDK</a> . <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Animation</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/df2/f23/822/df2f23822d9990baedb5310cd8fd3f02.gif"><br></div></div><br><h2>  Moving and decision making </h2><br>  Most physical robots, be it a manipulator, a mobile robot, or anything else, need to somehow move in space.  And sometimes in the process of these movements, especially if the conditions or environment of operation can change significantly, the robot needs to change the trajectory and speed of movement. <br><br><h3>  Orientation in space </h3><br>  Allows you to determine the coordinates of the robot's own location in space, including inside buildings. <br><br>  <a href="https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2">Algorithm Example</a> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/258/a84/149/258a841492e34150ff764f197774c83a.jpg" alt="Work example" width="600"></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Video</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SeHwkZAZxuY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br><h3>  Decision making when moving </h3><br>  Allows the mobile robot to make decisions about the necessary maneuvers to optimize the trajectory of movement in a dynamic environment.

Therefore, depending on the requirements for the operating conditions of the robot, the developer needs to choose a design variant and optimize the code. <br><br>  Possible options: <br><br><ul><li>  computing on a dedicated PC </li><li>  cloud computing </li><li>  calculations on board </li></ul><br>  The choice made will dictate its requirements both to the equipment and to the optimization of the algorithms. <br><br><h3>  Interaction </h3><br>  One algorithm is often not enough to solve a problem.  Therefore, when using algorithms in robots, developers will have to face an integration task, i.e.  It is necessary to ensure interaction with other algorithms and software. <br><br><h2>  Instead of output </h2><br>  Working in a company developing software for robots, one often encounters various robots and algorithms, and also finds new approaches to solving complex problems.  He drew attention to the fact that interest in functions related to safety and the possibility of autonomous operation of mechanisms, especially in close proximity to people, has recently increased. <br><br>  The presented review contains a far from exhaustive list of tasks and algorithms.  The examples are given by one algorithm chosen by the author.  Also note that any of the presented tasks can be solved in many other ways and / or using other algorithms.  If you have any more examples of problems with algorithms on hand, leave them in the comments. <br><br>  PS: For dessert - a beautiful video from the “heaven” with a wheeled robot and a decision-making system on board <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Video</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_OqdnG4AII8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div></div>
