<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Some time ago I was doing a <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/296109/">large comparative test of thermoses</a> .  And in the comments I was asked to make a test of thermocup.  Well, I could not remain indifferent, and I myself am interested in this topic, because the thermomug is a true companion for the motorist. <br>  According to tradition, at the end of the material video review. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4p/da/re/4pdarea4aaixtjvwwnagdyel_og.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I will begin, perhaps, with the device of a thermomug.  It is not much different from the device of a modern thermos with a metal bulb.  Those who have not read my previous review, I will give a photo of a sawn along a thermos. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/iy/u5/3c/iyu53c1erim92iacgcd8hojxnhq.jpeg"></div><br>  The thermomug looks the same, with the only difference that instead of a cork and a cap of a glass, it has a cap with a valve for drinking.  And the volume of the thermocup varies from 0.3 to 0.5 liters, because one person does not need more for a short period.  If more liquid is needed or a long-distance departure is planned, then a thermos from 1 to 2 liters is taken. <br><br>  Thermal mugs enjoy deserved love of motorists and cyclists, because you can take a hot / cold drink with you and drink it that way almost all day.  But how long the drink will keep the temperature, I became very interested. <br><br>  <b>Testing method</b> <br><br>  In order for us to have not just an experiment, but to have at least some practical value, we need a repeatable method.  Therefore, I did everything as simple and affordable as possible.  To measure the temperature, a thermometer Datronn TP-3001 was used.  On the long leg there is a thermocouple, supports measurement from -50 to +300 degrees, the measurement error is 0.1 degrees - for our test this is more than sufficient accuracy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nz/8p/tg/nz8ptgafzy-gix0_7h-lr5fveqk.jpeg"><br>  Then everything was simple: boiling water was poured into the thermocup, the lid was twisted and the time began to count.  For all the mugs, the temperature was measured every hour for 12 hours.  The result was a plate with a large number of values ​​and rather curious graphics. <br><br>  For example, it looks like the graphics of two mugs: the favorite and the worst thermomug: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zg/-q/oq/zg-qoq0rvgrboy23tskc6_rrnxk.jpeg"><br><br>  All measurements were carried out at room temperature of 25 degrees.  Still, this is not a thermos, and no one will put a mug on the ice next to the hole.  But to put in a cup holder in a warm car or on the table, next to the working computer in the office - this is easy. <br><br>  We also tested for ergonomics: this included the test of holding and opening the lid with one hand.  Because in the car, even with an automatic transmission, you can only release one hand.  And the view ahead such a circle should not overlap. <br><br>  And of course, I want to see in front of me a beautiful mug, and not a piece of plastic from Uncle Liao with burrs around the edges, so the design also mattered.  Now let's get started. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3e/qt/_m/3eqt_mjo8duqhysz_j_ffq9bauk.jpeg"><br>  12 place - Rosenberg RSS-415003-G <br>  <b>Price:</b> 256 p. <br>  <b>Capacity:</b> 0.48l <br><br>  Despite the fact that the manufacturer indicated in the materials "stainless steel", by weight and to the touch, it is a plastic cup.  When boiled water was poured, the body and the lid warmed up very well.  After 5 hours, the water in the mug cooled from 100 degrees to 36. In addition, the valve, which is designed to shut off the water supply, is made shaky and when the mug is turned over, the water just starts to pour out.  Therefore, I do not recommend this mug to anyone. <br><br>  + Price <br>  - Poor quality, fast cooling, leaking <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rj/wt/7z/rjwt7zveind2qvwd_kow-i4iqvm.jpeg"><br>  11th place - Thermos DF-5000 <br>  <b>Price:</b> 1200 r. <br>  <b>Capacity:</b> 0.5 l <br><br>  It's amazing for whom this mug can be made.  Its volume is not great at all, and its dimensions are simply depressing.  Even me, a man with not the smallest hands, is not comfortable holding a mug.  What to say about the opening of the valve on the go - it is generally impossible to do with one hand.  If we talk about the immediate function of the thermal mug, then nothing good can be said either: the body immediately after pouring boiling water became warm, and the lid hot.  It’s good that it doesn’t spill over.  By the way, such a mug does not fit into any cup holder. <br><br>  + Rubber edging for fingers <br>  - Large size, cools quickly <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gd/cu/ju/gdcujuisruo0mjzpsdfv9vlxgbq.jpeg"><br>  10 place - elGusto Grano <br>  <b>Price:</b> 1590 p. <br>  <b>Capacity:</b> 0.47 L <br><br>  One of the most stylish and pleasant to the touch mugs.  The outer coating is made of Soft Touch plastic, so it is especially nice to hold it in your hands.  Moreover, her body is very warm - it is good to warm your hands on such a mug.  So the manufacturer declares that the mug will retain heat for only 3 hours and this is not far from the truth.  Boiling water reached body temperature at the fifth hour of the test.  The valve is implemented as a button and works well.  Drinking from a cup is also convenient. <br><br>  + Great design, very pleasant to the touch <br>  - cools quickly <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hm/9v/3z/hm9v3zqgqv9ndsdb9_8e-hbfjna.jpeg"><br>  9th place - Stanley Master 0.53l <br>  <b>Price:</b> 2800 p. <br>  <b>Capacity:</b> 0.53 L <br><br>  It is very difficult to call Stanley Master a thermomug.  It is rather a small thermos with a cork.  Drinking from such a mug can only be completely unscrewing the cork.  And the whole feature of the thermomug is lost.  Yes, and this empty mug weighs more than half a kilogram - this is the weight of two other mugs of dough combined.  The coating is rough and resembles some kind of rubber coating.  In the upper part of the mug there is a noticeable warmth, therefore, in the tests of heat saving, Stanley Master 0.53l is also far from winning. <br><br>  + Brutal design <br>  - You can drink only by unscrewing the stopper, high price, high weight <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wk/sv/cq/wksvcqljpnzx1ylyhjl3t-z7nug.jpeg"><br>  8 place - Starbucks 10.30 <br>  <b>Price:</b> 1500 r. <br>  <b>Capacity:</b> 0.355 L <br><br>  Starbucks branded chain of coffee shops attracts special attention - you can go to them and take coffee in your container, and then enjoy a hot drink all day.  The rubber coating on the “waist” of the cup is really very ergonomic.  And although the upper part of the mug and lid are always warm, the drink will warm the owner for at least 8 hours.  True with one hand on the go is not very convenient to flip the cover, but in extreme positions, it is fixed quite firmly.  Although it is better not to drink while driving, the mouth is decently wide and will close the visibility. <br><br>  + Good ergonomics, non-slip rubber coating on the "waist" <br>  - Warm lid and top, wide neck <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tg/jb/8b/tgjb8be8yhdtfzdcqmeeachcpxs.jpeg"><br>  7th place - LaPLAYA Thermo Mug SS Strap <br>  <b>Price:</b> 1300 p. <br>  <b>Capacity:</b> 0.5 l <br><br>  The only mug in the test with its own wrist strap: it is convenient to walk with such a mug and it will never be lost.  And although her form is a little pot-bellied, and it is more convenient to keep it in the upper part, the thermomug deserves attention, if only because even after 12 hours the liquid in it was above 50 degrees.  The valve opening mechanism is on the top cover and it is problematic to open it with one hand, but this can be done while the cup is in the cup holder.  The upper part of the test was slightly warm, but this did not prevent to show a good result. <br><br>  + Good temperature readings, strap included <br>  - Not very ergonomic shape mugs <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jq/vc/gk/jqvcgknayng7pqmja9rykckbtq0.jpeg"><br>  6 place - Biostal NMT-400W <br>  <b>Price:</b> 950 p. <br>  <b>Capacity:</b> 0.4 l <br><br>  Stylish and pleasant to the touch mug.  After pouring boiling water, the upper part of the cup and the lid immediately became warm, that is, the heat loss is clearly felt.  Despite this, the circle managed to keep warm for 12 hours, which is very pleasing.  The lid lock is also a lock, but with fast pouring, the appearance of gizzards is possible, since there is simply no additional air hole.  But for such a cost is forgivable. <br><br>  + Good design, pleasant to the touch <br>  - Warm lid and top of the cup, there is no hole for air supply when turning <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1m/3e/hn/1m3ehns2gl9zirx6rdjm99nh9gm.jpeg"><br>  5th place - Contigo West Loop <br>  <b>Price:</b> 2400 p. <br>  <b>Capacity:</b> 0.47 L <br><br>  One of the most stylish and ergonomic mugs.  It comes in different colors and is even found branded, but remains very interesting.  The opening valve is located opposite the water hole, so the water just does not pour out - the hole is open, only while the button is pressed.  There is also a lock - a button on the top of the cover.  The mug fits perfectly in the hand and does not slip due to the rubberized upper part.  In the temperature tests does not shine, but by the end of 12 hours the water was still above 40 degrees - the lid was hot. <br><br>  + Excellent ergonomics, good water constipation mechanism <br>  - Not the best temperature indicators <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/om/_o/gw/om_ogwc61g_2pp3-eqdennxgnb4.jpeg"><br>  4th place - Arctic 705-500 <br>  <b>Price:</b> 1800 p. <br>  <b>Capacity:</b> 0.5 l <br><br>  Surprisingly, from the fourth to the second place the thermomug looks very similar, although temperature tests say that there are differences.  The opening button is also a lock.  The lid is folded back in a spring, and because of the small diameter of the cup, the view does not overlap.  Here the truth is that the lid is somehow holding on tightly and the gaps in the lid mounting design raise questions.  Nevertheless, the thermomug showed itself well and kept the temperature to above 50 degrees until the end of the test. <br><br>  + Good design, ergonomic <br>  - Backlash and total looseness of the cover <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/er/7x/jl/er7xjldl3uxrrwvg4pvocmmtjou.jpeg"><br>  3rd place - Woodsurf Quick Open 2.0 <br>  <b>Price:</b> 1450 p. <br>  <b>Capacity:</b> 0.48 L <br><br>  Despite the fact that this group is similar to the product of the Arctic company, it is significantly different.  The cover fastens securely and does not hang out.  Plastic is strong, and on the inside of the lid-stopper there is even a silicone strainer to brew tea and tea did not interfere with enjoying the taste of this tea - no other competitor has this.  Well, the temperature indicators are encouraging: after 12 hours the water is still hot, and the temperature is more than 56 degrees.  Even the bottom has a rubber base so as not to slide on the table. <br><br>  + Good design, ergonomics, tea strainer, rubberized bottom <br>  - It is not always clear by the button whether it is blocked or not. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pe/ly/2m/pely2mcb6vnrw9x_0_0hrhoma7y.jpeg"><br>  2 place - Zojirushi SM-KB48-TM <br>  <b>Price:</b> 3200 p. <br>  <b>Capacity:</b> 0.48 L <br><br>  Mug from Zojirushi is a very pleasant and useful thing.  Excellent heat and very easy to use.  There is a separate sliding button on the lid that blocks the opening of the lid.  From the inside of the lid you can see that there is a special channel for supplying air so that there is no gurgling when drinking - the drink will flow evenly.  The flask is teflon coated on the inside, which makes it easier to launder after use. <br><br>  + Good design, separate opening lock button, air supply mechanism, teflon bulb coating <br>  - Price <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/a9/7_/uj/a97_ujfpd9nmlrrlrqooiumouxs.jpeg"><br>  1st place - Tiger MCB-H048 <br>  <b>Price:</b> 3170 p. <br>  <b>Capacity:</b> 0.48 L <br><br>  The first place of the review was deservedly taken by a Tiger thermomug.  Outwardly, it is markedly different from the last three and has a more ergonomic shape, expanding upwards.  The opening button is located on the front of the thumb, and the lock on the upper end.  And looking from the top down immediately it becomes clear whether the opening is blocked or not.  Interestingly, unlike similar competitors, the cap is not screwed onto the flask, but screwed on, that is, the thread itself is inside.  Apparently, this was the decisive factor that made it possible to get the highest fluid temperature after 12 hours of the test - 63 degrees. <br><br>  + Excellent design, competent ergonomics, easily recognized button lock, good heat saving <br>  - Price <br><br>  I will give the graph and the numbers of the resulting test.  It is clearly seen on the graph that the cooling takes place unevenly and the worse the circle is insulated, the faster the circle cools down during the first hours, and then the graph becomes flat. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/iu/ls/_1/iuls_1-ryweha2tb8se3aw5j6ho.jpeg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ja/ld/zm/jaldzmw-w6xofdwdlb2xu5xorbe.jpeg"><br><br>  UPD: added a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KrJX61CNEUJOay9XE1BfAGpG4fkaZCFhJPU0AofF_T0/edit%3Fusp%3Dsharing">table in google</a> <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  Testing turned out to be very entertaining, because even externally similar thermocup can noticeably differ in ergonomics or materials used in manufacturing.  In addition, the gap in temperature between the best and worst thermocup was 35 degrees, which is quite a lot.  During the test, I dashed about 1000 kilometers and used almost all the circles.  Almost because Rosenberg simply did not want to take, and Thermos did not fit into the cup holder. <br><br>  I can also say that it is the most convenient to drink from the "thin" thermo mugs while driving, since they do not completely obscure the view.  Well, the winner, Tiger thermomug, I liked it so much that I am ready to give it to one of my most active subscribers on my Youtube channel. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s061UdSJmP4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
