And this year we also want to look into the near future and understand where DevOps is heading. <br><br>  Here is a list of topics that we would like to address in the section: <br><ul><li>  Containers, orchestration, cloud technologies (Docker, Kubernetes, Serverless). </li><li>  What is cloud?  Comparison of cloud services. </li><li>  DevOps implementation experience: success, failures, lost illusions. </li><li>  What is DevSecOps?  Practices for embedding the secure development process into the DevOps process, techniques and tools. </li><li>  CI / СD: only cases, only hardcore. </li><li>  Databases in the clouds. </li><li>  New approaches and tools in configuration management. </li></ul><br>  If you did not find the topic in the list, but you have something to share with the devops community, send a <a href="http://dump-ekb.ru/devops%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_term%3Dcfp_mobile_devops%26utm_content%3Dmobile_devops%26utm_campaign%3Ddump2019">request</a> anyway.

We are waiting for interesting reports on new tools and technologies in the development of Android and iOS, chips and lifehacks, common problems and ways to solve them. <br><br>  Here is a brief and incomplete list of the areas in which we receive reports for the Mobile section: <br><br><ol><li>  Mobile backend as a service.  Backendless and analogues.  Experience of use: success, failure, lessons. </li><li>  Cross-platform development: Xamarin, React Native, Flutter. </li><li>  Android technology. </li><li>  IOS technology. </li><li>  Mobile application architecture. </li></ol><br>  Did not find the topic in the list, but you have something to tell?
