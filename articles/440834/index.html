This year we are preparing 8 sections: Backend, Frontend, Mobile, Testing and QA, Devops, Design, Science and Management.

In this post - the topics that we want to discuss in the sections of DevOps and Mobile and instructions on how to become a speaker. <br><br>  Registration for participants is open.  One day left to buy a ticket for DUMP at the lowest price - 5,000 rubles.  From February 20, the price will rise to 6000 rubles.

Usability. Management. Practice) is the largest developer conference, which has been held in Yekaterinburg since 2011.  In 2018, she gathered 1,500 people from Yekaterinburg, Chelyabinsk, Tyumen, Ufa, Kurgan, Moscow, Izhevsk, Perm and other cities. <br><br>  Last year we spoke with Grigory Bakunov (Yandex), Alexey Akulovich (VKontakte), Sergey Abdulmanov (Mosigra), Alexey Savvateev (CEMI RAS), Alexander Burt, Zarema Khalilova (Uploadcare), Alexey Migutsky (Microsoft), Seryozha Popov (HTML Academy), Oleg Anastasyev (Odnoklassniki) and 37 more cool speakers. <br><br>  All videos of last year's reports can be viewed on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/videoitpeople/playlists">YouTube channel</a> .  Separately laid out <a href="https://disk.yandex.ru/d/YXGThWYk3UV8ud">presentations</a> and <a href="https://yadi.sk/a/xsyoRjP23YuYLx">photos</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2l/c6/hc/2lc6hczaqeasqbcyagqj9yg7x5s.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  <b>Program committee</b> </h2><br>  This year's DevOps section is being prepared by: <b>Mikhail Tsykarev,</b> Senior Leader of the Strategic Projects Group of the Strategic and Project Management Office of ICL Services, and Software Engineer at Odnoklassniki <b>Alexander Tarasov</b> . <br><br>  A section for mobile developers is being done by: iOS developer at Tochka bank <b>Maxim Keegan</b> , author of ETransport, Android developer in OSOME <b>Maxim Rovkin</b> and founder of GDG in Yekaterinburg, director of information technologies in the Medicine of the Future Medicine Incubator <b>Rodion Revin</b> . <br><br><h2>  <b>I want to speak at DUMP-2019</b> </h2><br>  Below, the program directors of the sections described topics that are of interest to us.  If you have something to say on one of these topics and you want to speak, <a href="http://dump-ekb.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_term%3Dcfp_mobile_devops%26utm_content%3Dmobile_devops%26utm_campaign%3Ddump2019">write to</a> us.

Applications are accepted until February 20. <br><br>  If you have not seen any topic in the list, but want to speak with her, please contact us anyway.  Perhaps the program committee will decide that the report will be super-useful and include it in the program. <br><br>  Themes for the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/it_people/blog/438458/">Backend, Frontend and Science</a> sections and for the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/it_people/blog/439840/">Design, Management, Testing</a> sections were described in separate posts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/d0/qt/r1/d0qtr1ziartmxhb40gchot5alhi.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  <b>Devops</b> </h3><br>  We have always been happy hardcore cases and proven solutions for large work projects.  And this year we also want to look into the near future and understand where DevOps is heading. <br><br>  Here is a list of topics that we would like to address in the section: <br><ul><li>  Containers, orchestration, cloud technologies (Docker, Kubernetes, Serverless). </li><li>  What is cloud?  Comparison of cloud services. </li><li>  DevOps implementation experience: success, failures, lost illusions. </li><li>  What is DevSecOps?  Practices for embedding the secure development process into the DevOps process, techniques and tools. </li><li>  CI / –°D: only cases, only hardcore. </li><li>  Databases in the clouds. </li><li>  New approaches and tools in configuration management. </li></ul><br>  If you did not find the topic in the list, but you have something to share with the devops community, send a <a href="http://dump-ekb.ru/devops%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_term%3Dcfp_mobile_devops%26utm_content%3Dmobile_devops%26utm_campaign%3Ddump2019">request</a> anyway.

We are waiting for interesting reports on new tools and technologies in the development of Android and iOS, chips and lifehacks, common problems and ways to solve them. <br><br>  Here is a brief and incomplete list of the areas in which we receive reports for the Mobile section: <br><br><ol><li>  Mobile backend as a service.  Backendless and analogues.  Experience of use: success, failure, lessons. </li><li>  Cross-platform development: Xamarin, React Native, Flutter. </li><li>  Android technology. </li><li>  IOS technology. </li><li>  Mobile application architecture. </li></ol><br>  Did not find the topic in the list, but you have something to tell?
