This version of the browser first appeared in 2012.  In 2016, the Redmond giant focused on IE 11, but did not abandon the top ten either.  However, the company has now decided to end its support for IE 10, although not immediately. <br><br>  The problem is that previous versions of Windows are not able to support IE 11, so Microsoft decided to limit Edge to Windows 10. With regard to Internet Explorer 10, it is supported by Windows Server 2012 and Windows Embedded 8 Standard.  But after January 14 of the next year, security updates will not be released for the browser. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Microsoft will stop updating and improving the features of the outdated browser.  Customers were advised to complete the transition from IE 10 to IE 11 until January 31, 2020, in which case they will be able to continue working with IE. <br><br>  At the same time, users, even when they are ready to pay for updates of an outdated browser, will not be able to do this - unlike Windows 7, updates for which can be received on a paid basis after the end of support.  Microsoft is determined to kill Internet Explorer 10. <br><br>  As for Server 2012, the corporation will release an update that will add IE11 to the environment instead of IE10. <br><br>  Windows 7 will also cease to support after January 14, 2020.  Only here users will be able to work with a paid service and receive security updates for their OS.  This form of work can be beneficial for companies that will cost more to switch to a new operating system than paid support for the old one. </div>
