<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I heard a warning in the Moscow metro that flying drones over Moscow is prohibited.  The explanation on the <a href="https://www.mos.ru/otvet-transport/gde-v-moskve-mozhno-zapuskat-kvadrokoptery-i-drony/">official website of the Mayor of Moscow mos.ru</a> refers to the <a href="https://minjust.consultant.ru/documents/19230">Order of the Ministry of Transport dated March 9, 2016 No. 48</a> , in which the table gives the coordinates of the areas prohibited for flights.  The penalty for violation of the ban for individuals ranges from 3,000 to 5,000 rubles. <br><br>  Since itâ€™s probably inconvenient to use the table, I decided to visualize it on Yandex maps. <br><br>  I recommend in advance before the flight to make sure that in an unfortunate set of circumstances you will not be penalized.  And it's just interesting to see where we have that :) <br><br> <a href="http://disik.ru/map180226.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/o1/zn/jw/o1znjwdz74qqeyrzh1xu6kmyc78.png"></a> </div>
