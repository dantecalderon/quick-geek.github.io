<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ed/dx/dd/eddxdddzur1edgqpdlsiz0xclcq.jpeg"><br><br>  Yesterday, Yandex launched its own online learning service, <a href="https://praktikum.yandex.ru/">Yandex.Pratikum</a> , where it will train specialists for the IT industry.  As promised, the development can be mastered in six months, if you give study ten hours a week.  To which level, the company does not specify.  The founder of Geekbrains, for example, says that <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/moikrug/blog/438298/">in six months it is quite possible to become a juna</a> and immediately find a job. <br><br>  However, Yandex on the service page in the column of expected salaries (they are <a href="https://moikrug.ru/salaries">calculated</a> using the <a href="https://moikrug.ru/salaries">My Circle calculator</a> ) defaults to the money that the middle receives.  In general, the Practicum courses will last from six to nine months. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At the start of the service, Yandex launched three areas - front-end development, web development and data analytics.  As they say in the company, they analyzed more than 400,000 vacancies and selected the most required skills and technologies. <br><br>  Therefore, front-tenders will be taught to build a site by layout, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, work through Git and customize the build of the project with the Webpack tool. <br><br>  Web developers will be taught about the same thing as front-end vendors, plus Node.js, SQL, creating APIs and managing the logic of interaction with the server.  Analysts will learn how to work with Python and its main libraries, Jupyter Notebook and SQL. <br><br>  In the near future, Yandex plans to teach six more professions: a backend developer, a data engineer, a machine learning specialist, a neural network specialist, an interface designer, and a product manager.  They will learn everything from scratch, know something about the development for admission, according to Yandex, is not necessary.  But you must have at least secondary education.  That is, you can spit on the university, but quitting school in the eighth grade for the courses will not work. <br><br>  The theory of "Yandex" promises to convey in simple words: <br><blockquote>  Without "do not forget to backup the default styles before deploying the config to the server" </blockquote>  Although, it seems, there is no way to get away from professional slang, and it is not clear how to avoid it in practice. <br><br>  Also for Practicum, we developed an online simulator in which you can write code and immediately see your mistakes.  The teachers will be practicing developers.  Only "Yandex" calls them "mentors", and teaching - "support."  It sounds as if the emphasis will be on self-study. <br><br>  At the end of the course, the company promises that graduates will have a portfolio and a Yandex certificate.  But theoretically, after the course you can stay without them - in the end you need to pass the thesis.  It would be great if it would not be such a formality as in universities. </div>
