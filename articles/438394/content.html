<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mk/hm/0o/mkhm0oloevihjxl0o8ar0nlld5e.png"></p><br><p>  The PHP framework team Yii has released version 2.0.16, containing <a href="">more than a hundred fixes and some improvements</a> .  Fixed several security issues. </p><br><p>  The branch Yii 2.0 reached a freeze <a href="https://www.yiiframework.com/news/156/yii-2-1-and-yii-2-0-feature-freeze">more than a year ago</a> , which means that it mainly accepts corrections.  This was done to allow the Yii team to focus on Yii 3. At the very end of this post there is a little more information about Yii 3. </p><br><p>  This release includes several changes that may affect existing applications.  Be sure to read <a href="">UPGRADE.md</a> . </p><br><p>  Many thanks <a href="https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/graphs/contributors">to the members of the Yii community</a> who are participating in the development.  Without you, such a large-scale project would be impossible.  Special thanks to translators who keep the documentation up to date. </p><br><p>  Below are the most interesting improvements that still managed to leak into the release.  The full list, as usual, can be found in <a href="">CHANGELOG</a> . </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2 id="active-record">  Active record </h2><br><p>  Salem Ouerdani, @tunecino added behavior for optimistic locking. </p><br><p> Optimistic locking allows multiple users to simultaneously edit a record and avoid potential server side conflicts.  In the case when a user tries to save edits based on obsolete data (because another user has already been saved), a <code>StaleObjectException</code> , and no update or deletion is made. </p><br><p>  The mechanism of such a lock was implemented in the first versions of Yii, but it was not so easy to use it correctly.  Now just. </p><br><p>  Documentation can be found in the <a href="https://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/2.0/en/db-active-record">official manual.</a> <br>  and <a href="https://www.yiiframework.com/doc/api/2.0/yii-behaviors-optimisticlockbehavior">the OptimisticLockBehavior API</a> . </p><br><h2 id="migracii">  Migrations </h2><br><p>  The console migration generator now uses table prefixes by default.  If you want to change this, you can set <code>yii\console\controllers\MigrateController::useTablePrefix</code> to <code>false</code> in the config of console commands. </p><br><h2 id="bazy-dannyh">  Database </h2><br><ul><li>  The MySQL driver now supports fractional second accuracy for temporary types (MySQL is required&gt; = 5.6.4). </li><li>  The Oracle driver now supports sequence dumping. </li></ul><br><h2 id="helpery">  Helpers </h2><br><ul><li>  <code>yii\helpers\Inflector</code> learned to work correctly with UTF-8. </li><li>  Added flag <code>yii\mutex\FileMutex::$isWindows</code> for Windows Ball on Unix guest machines. </li><li>  The <code>yii\helpers\UnsetArrayValue</code> , <code>yii\helpers\ReplaceArrayValue</code> can now be restored after serialization with <code>var_export()</code> . </li></ul><br><h2 id="gridview">  Gridview </h2><br><p>  The <code>$filterOnFocusOut</code> option is <code>$filterOnFocusOut</code> , which determines whether filtering should be performed when the focus is lost. </p><br><h2 id="jquery">  jQuery </h2><br><p>  Now you can install jQuery 3.3. </p><br><h2 id="mutex">  Mutex </h2><br><ul><li>  The frequency of attempts to acquire a <code>yii\mutex\FileMutex::acquireLock()</code> increased if <code>$timeout</code> provided. </li><li>  Added support for <code>$timeout</code> in <code>yii\mutex\PgsqlMutex::acquire()</code> . </li></ul><br><h2 id="ispravleniya-bezopasnosti">  Security patches </h2><br><p>  Two security issues have been fixed: </p><br><ul><li>  CVE-2018-14578: bypassing the CSRF token check in <code>\yii\web\Request::getMethod()</code> </li><li>  CVE-2018-19454: unnecessary logging of confidential information in <code>\yii\log\Target</code> </li></ul><br><h2 id="shablony-prilozheniy">  Application Templates </h2><br><ul><li>  Codeception configs have been cleaned in both the basic and advanced templates. </li><li>  A simple Docker config has been added to the Advanced template. </li><li>  The Advanced template now requires a newer version of Codeception, which only works since PHP 7.0.  Older applications will work as before. </li></ul><br><h2 id="nemnogo-o-yii-30">  Little about Yii 3.0 </h2><br><p>  The next major version of Yii will be 3.0.  A detailed announcement will be later, but for now briefly: </p><br><p>  <em>Updated architecture</em> : the framework is divided into <a href="">separate packages</a> . <br>  This will allow you to collect from them what you need. </p><br><p>  <em>JavaScript-independent</em> : along with the reorganization of the source code, Yii is decoupled from the JavaScript framework in the kernel. <br>  Yii key packages do not require jQuery. </p><br><p>  <em>Compatible with PSR</em> : Yii 3 will follow the recommendations of PHP-FIG.  Many PSRs have already been implemented: logging, cache, DI, and others. </p><br><p>  Yii 3.0 is under active development.  A detailed announcement will be made to achieve the alpha version. </p></div>
