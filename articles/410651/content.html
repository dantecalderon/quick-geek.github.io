<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I would like to inform all interested people again or just to remind that tomorrow (Tuesday, 02.27.18) one of the largest international exhibitions in the field of embedded electronic (“embedded systems”) - embedded world 2018 will start at the Nuremberg exhibition center. <br><br>  The exhibition takes place, as usual, for three days - and provides a lot of interesting material to get acquainted with the latest trends in the field of modern electronics and related software - as well as in the fields of industrial automation, robotics, digital technologies and all network trends (Internet of Things / IoT and other buns). <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  This year, the focus is on autonomous systems - and this is not only roboomobili now popularized, but also all sorts of systems of artificial intelligence, machine vision, self-propelled robots of a wide range of applications, intelligent environment systems, intelligent buildings, computers, assistants, etc. -other <br><br>  <b>A little trick</b> : at the booth of the Weka Fachmedien publishing house, after filling out a small questionnaire, you will have the opportunity to subscribe for a whole range of usually expensive professional magazines in electronics design, electrical engineering, industrial design and modern automotive electronics.  The subscription is NOT automatically extended and does not become paid - so you risk nothing (but read the form before signing :). <br><br>  UPD: Free tickets are distributed here: <br><br>  <a href="https://www.embedded-world.de/en/visitors/tickets/voucher">www.embedded-world.de/en/visitors/tickets/voucher</a> <br><br>  UPD2: Actually, I can recommend Vector's booth as interesting (it is one of the largest) - there are software and hardware for the development and calibration of car electronics presented by all automakers and car parts suppliers. <br><br>  Not far away is the stand of their direct competitor, the company ETAS - but the “Vector” is usually much more informative, more interesting and richer, although they work directly with ETAS, for example, BMW and Volvo. </div>
