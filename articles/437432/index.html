Users now have release snapshots that include not only the source code, but all related artifacts.  You no longer need to manually collect the source code, the build output, and other metadata or artifacts associated with the released version of your code.  In addition, Releases are the basis for a wider and more reliable interaction of releases in the future. </p><br><h3 id="upravlenie-portfelem-podderzhivaet-bolee-slozhnye-struktury-dekompozicii-rabot">  Portfolio management supports more complex work breakdown structures. </h3><br><p>  <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/2019/01/22/gitlab-11-7-released/">Multi-level Child Epics</a> is the latest addition to GitLab portfolio management available in Ultimate.  Child Epics allow you to create multi-level work structures, helping you manage more complex projects and work plans.  Now the epic contains both tasks and epics.  This structure provides a direct link between planned and implemented tasks for their implementation. </p><br><h3 id="optimizaciya-razrabotki-javascript-s-pomoschyu-reestrov-npm">  JavaScript Development Optimization with NPM Registries </h3><br><p>  Gitlab 11.7 Premium delivers <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/2019/01/22/gitlab-11-7-released/">NPM registries</a> directly to GitLab, providing a standard, more secure way to share and control NPM package versions between projects.  Just share the package name, and NPM and GitLab will handle everything else in one interface! </p><br><h3 id="i-mnogoe-drugoe">  And much more </h3><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  Determining which functions of our monthly releases are the main ones is a tough choice, so let's name a couple of additional interesting features: </p><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/2019/01/22/gitlab-11-7-released/">Fix vulnerabilities with a correction file</a> : As you know, GitLab security features help detect vulnerable objects.  With GitLab 11.7, it will be possible to fix this vulnerability and offer a solution for Node.js projects managed with Yarn.  And although this is our first official correction feature, you can be sure: this is just the beginning! </li><li>  <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/2019/01/22/gitlab-11-7-released/">API integration with Kubernetes</a> : If you create many clusters or consider yourself a Kubernetes virtuoso, here's the Kubernetes API for you - it will significantly reduce manual actions and make your life much easier! </li><li>  <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/2019/01/22/gitlab-11-7-released/">View pipeline between projects</a> : With the ability to view pipelines between projects, you can easily find out what information is at your fingertips! </li></ul><br><br><p>  Next is the full list of features for GitLab 11.7! </p><br><h2 id="osnovnye-funkcii-dobavlennye-v-vypusk-gitlab-117">  Key features added to GitLab 11.7 release </h2><br><h3 id="publikaciya-relizov-dlya-vashih-proektov">  Release releases for your projects </h3><br><p>  (Available in: CORE, STARTER, PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, FREE, BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD) </p><br><p>  Our new Releases feature adds the ability to create releases in GitLab and view them on the summary page.  Releases are a snapshot of the source, links and other metadata or artifacts associated with the released version of your code, and allow users of your project to easily find the latest released version of your code. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/314/059/a04/314059a0492df282ca1326292f5aab16.png" alt="image"></p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/releases/index.html">Documentation</a> <br>  <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/41766">Task</a> </p><br><h3 id="mnogourovnevye-dochernie-epiki-multi-level-child-epics">  Multi-level child epics (Multi-level Child Epics) </h3><br><p>  (Available in: ULTIMATE, GOLD) </p><br><p>  The epics and tasks work well together, providing flexibility in defining long-term work plans.  However, they still have a limit - they provide only a two-layer structure. <br>  In this issue we present the child epics.  Now you can have an epic containing both tasks and epics.  This allows you to create multi-level work structures.  Present even more long-term strategic initiatives or goals of the organization as epic high-level, and below them there will be several more levels of epic - break them down into more tangible results, up to tasks. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7e0/d19/939/7e0d199396ce3a98d12191217945fbdf.png" alt="image"><br>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/epics/">Documentation</a> <br>  <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/8333">Task</a> </p><br><h3 id="prosmotr-konveyera-mezhdu-proektami">  View pipeline between projects </h3><br><p>  (Available in: PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, SILVER, GOLD) </p><br><p>  Expand ascending or descending inter-project conveyors directly from the view of the conveyor, providing visibility through the conveyors?  - regardless of which project they start or end with. </p><br><p> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ba/rx/kd/barxkd2-oj5zkdixvcapanlccem.png"></a> </p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines.html">Documentation</a> <br>  <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/2122">Task</a> </p><br><h3 id="ustranit-uyazvimost-s-pomoschyu-fayla-korrekcii">  Eliminate vulnerability using correction file </h3><br><p>  (Available in: ULTIMATE, GOLD) </p><br><p>  GitLab detects various types of vulnerabilities in your applications, and also suggests possible ways to fix them. </p><br><p> Starting with GitLab 11.7, you can download the correction file and apply it to your repository with the <code>git apply</code> .  Then send the change back to the repository, and <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/security_dashboard.html">the security dashboard will</a> confirm that the vulnerability has disappeared!  The resolution process is simpler, and the time required to deploy the solution is less.  We now support dependency scanning vulnerabilities for the <code>yarn</code> package <code>yarn</code> , and in order for this to work, there is no need to change anything.  The patch will be available whenever possible in the vulnerability details window. </p><br><p> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sb/tb/ew/sbtbewbo6_mcged1j0mfrfco0ae.png"></a> </p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/">Documentation</a> <br>  <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/5656">Task</a> </p><br><h3 id="nastroyte-sekrety-prilozheniya-kubernetes-kak-peremennye">  Set Kubernetes application secrets as variables </h3><br><p>  (Available in: CORE, STARTER, PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, FREE, BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD) </p><br><p>  Operators and administrators need to configure sensitive information outside the application repository - to reduce the risk and vulnerability of confidential data.  GitLab now offers the ability to configure sensitive data as environment variables that are made available to the application in the Kubernetes cluster. </p><br><p>  Simply add <code>K8S_SECRET_</code> to your variable, and the corresponding CI pipeline will take the secret variable of your application to fill the secret Kubernetes. </p><br><p> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dw/8w/gy/dw8wgyjcqr8egpece9g1rp5rmfi.png"></a> </p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/autodevops/">Documentation</a> <br>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/autodevops/">Task</a> </p><br><h3 id="reestr-npm">  NPM Registry </h3><br><p>  (Available in: PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, SILVER, GOLD) </p><br><p>  JavaScript developers need a secure, standardized way to share and manage NPM package versions between projects.  The NPM Registry offers developers of low-level services a way to publish their code in this way. </p><br><p>  In GitLab 11.7, we proudly offer NPM registries built directly into GitLab.  You can share a simple package naming convention for using this library in any Node.js project, and NPM and GitLab will do the rest using a single interface.  This feature is available in GitLab Premium. </p><br><p>  Here is <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/examples/npm-publish">an example of a project</a> that collects and submits to the registry GitLab NPM.  Simple as that! </p><br><p> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xc/cm/cb/xccmcbc59ankcdjdgquzf5vgmay.png"></a> </p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/packages/npm_registry.html">Documentation</a> <br>  <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/5934">Task</a> </p><br><h3 id="podderzhka-api-dlya-integracii-s-kubernetes">  API support for integration with Kubernetes </h3><br><p>  (Available in: CORE, STARTER, PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, FREE, BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD) </p><br><p>  In this issue, we added API support to our integration with Kubernetes.  All actions that are currently available in the graphical interface: such as enumerating, adding and deleting a Kubernetes cluster, are now available via the API.  Teams use new functionality to create a cluster as part of their workflow. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/625/6ac/20c/6256ac20ca849ce5020fa303ac7ea940.png" alt="image"></p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/project_clusters.html">Documentation</a> <br>  <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/40473">Task</a> </p><br><h2 id="drugie-uluchsheniya-v-gitlab-117">  Other improvements in GitLab 11.7 </h2><br><h3 id="pole-filtra-poiska-dlya-navigacii-po-doske-zadach">  Search filter field for navigating to the task board </h3><br><p>  (Available in: STARTER, PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD) </p><br><p>  Teams often use a lot of task boards for a particular project or panel.  This makes it difficult to navigate the drop-down list - if the list is very long.  In this release, we present a search filter.  Just enter a few characters in the filter field to quickly narrow down the list of tasks that interest you. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cab/075/82f/cab07582f6382d491a21d6e660d4301e.png" alt="image"></p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issue_board.html">Documentation</a> <br>  <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/7715">Task</a> </p><br><h3 id="redizayn-spiska-proektov">  Project List Redesign </h3><br><p>  (Available in: CORE, STARTER, PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, FREE, BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD) </p><br><p>  Projects are full-fledged residents of GitLab, and we want to make project lists visually pleasing and convenient for analysis. </p><br><p>  In GitLab 11.7, we presented a user interface redesign for a list of projects: a special focus on readability and a brief description of the project‚Äôs activities.  We provided each line of the project with additional information about the project and spaces, and <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/55669">continue the</a> design <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/55669">iteration</a> based on feedback. </p><br><p> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/st/k_/xt/stk_xtafgnk7leam0nq_mm88wia.png"></a> </p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/">Documentation</a> <br>  <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/51944">Task</a> </p><br><h3 id="podderzhka-universalnyh-pochtovyh-yaschikov-vklyuchaya-microsoft-exchange-i-google-groups-dlya-funkciy-vhodyaschey-elektronnoy-pochty">  Universal mailbox support, including Microsoft Exchange and Google Groups, for incoming email functions </h3><br><p>  (Available in: CORE, STARTER, PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, FREE, BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD) </p><br><p>  GitLab has some great features that use incoming email.  For example, an <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/reply_by_email.html">e-mail response</a> , a <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/create_new_issue.html">new</a> <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/reply_by_email.html">e-mail</a> <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/create_new_issue.html">task</a> , a <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/index.html">new merge-request e-mail</a> and <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/service_desk.html">a support service</a> .  Previously, these functions could be used only using an email server configured for sub-addressing. </p><br><p>  GitLab now supports emails with subaddressing and interception using the new email format, which allows you to use more email servers with GitLab, including Microsoft Exchange and Google Groups (which do not support subaddressing). </p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/incoming_email.html">Documentation</a> <br>  <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/29951">Task</a> </p><br><h3 id="import-zadach-csv">  Import CSV Tasks </h3><br><p>  (Available in: CORE, STARTER, PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, FREE, BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD) </p><br><p>  Often teams, starting to use GitLab, use different tools and outdated data.  You may be using Jira right now, but would like to move on to the tasks of GitLab. </p><br><p>  Now the transition has become easier.  Many problem tracking systems allow for the export of CSV, so import such export of tasks into GitLab - this will allow you to continue to manage existing work, importing obsolete data into GitLab, and, as necessary, search and retrieve.  This will work with Jira or any task tracking system that generates a CSV export. </p><br><p>  GitLab also has the <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/csv_export.html">function to export to CSV</a> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3f1/933/8c7/3f19338c75cc5bf8c53f28111efd3e3f.png" alt="image"></p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/csv_import.html">Documentation</a> <br>  <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/49231">Task</a> </p><br><h3 id="sha-korotkoy-fiksacii-dostupen-v-kachestve-peremennoy-sredy">  SHA short commit available as environment variable </h3><br><p>  (Available in: CORE, STARTER, PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, FREE, BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD) </p><br><p>  Git SHA are 40-character pointers to specific objects (ie, commits) in the Git repository.  Often, displaying the full string is cumbersome, and I want to show the first eight characters as a quick (although not guaranteed unique) link.  For this purpose, we have added the <code>CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA</code> environment <code>CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA</code> to the CI pipeline, which will give you the first part of the new SHA commit. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/467/5a3/dc0/4675a3dc0ae3d77fcafbdc629cafcd2a.png" alt="image"></p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/">Documentation</a> <br>  <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/48061">Task</a> </p><br><h3 id="bolee-strogie-ogranicheniya-na-samoutverzhdenie">  More stringent restrictions on self-assertion </h3><br><p>  (Available in: STARTER, PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD) </p><br><p>  Code verification is an essential practice for every successful project, and it should not be the change author.  By default, self-assertion of merge-requests is not allowed, but the criterion for the ban is not the commit in the merge-request, but the authorship of the request. </p><br><p>  Beginning with GitLab 11.7, these restrictions also prevent the authors from approving their own changes in Merge Requests.  So changes created by several engineers receive completely independent review of the code and approval. </p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/merge_request_approvals.html">Documentation</a> <br>  <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/3845">Task</a> </p><br><h3 id="podderzhka-avtorizacii-dlya-vyborki-inkludov">  Authorization support for sampling inclusions </h3><br><p>  (Available in: CORE, STARTER, PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, FREE, BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD) </p><br><p>  When you include external files in the definition of the pipeline using the <code>include</code> keyword, they are selected using HTTP / HTTPS requests.  Now you can access yamls in another project without open access (for example, a private project on GitLab.com) using credentials with which the pipeline works. </p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/">Documentation</a> <br>  <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/53903">Task</a> </p><br><h3 id="filtr-uyazvimostey-v-paneli-bezopasnosti-gruppy">  Vulnerability Filter in Group Security Panel </h3><br><p>  (Available in: ULTIMATE, GOLD) </p><br><p>  The group security panel allows security teams to keep everything under control, revealing vulnerabilities that affect their groups. </p><br><p>  Using GitLab 11.7, filter the displayed vulnerabilities by severity, report type, and project name.  Thanks to this ability, you can focus on what you need and quickly access your data, which is especially useful when there are a lot of records in the list. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2n/n8/wx/2nn8wxcumnjh_t_6jxx8fdowtl4.png"></a> </p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/security_dashboard/">Documentation</a> <br>  <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/6240">Task</a> </p><br><h3 id="pokazat-rezultaty-skanirovaniya-zavisimostey-na-paneli-bezopasnosti-gruppy">  Show dependency scan results in group security panel </h3><br><p>  (Available in: ULTIMATE, GOLD) </p><br><p>  The group security panel was originally released only with <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/sast.html">SAST</a> results, so users could not manage other types of vulnerabilities using this feature. </p><br><p>  With GitLab 11.7, <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/dependency_scanning.html">dependency scan</a> results are added to the set of available data.  If you are already using the <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/">new report syntax</a> , you will automatically see the results in the information panel.  The <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/autodevops/">Auto DevOps</a> template <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/autodevops/">has</a> also been updated, and now <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/">GitLab Runner</a> 11.5 or higher is required to correctly execute the dependency scanning job. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ob/ms/jn/obmsjn3qrhjp8ny2shlhkx_njhk.png"></a> </p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/security_dashboard/">Documentation</a> <br>  <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/8481">Task</a> </p><br><h3 id="vklyuchit-fayly-ci--cd-iz-drugih-proektov-i-shablonov">  Include CI / CD files from other projects and templates </h3><br><p>  (Available in: CORE, STARTER, PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, FREE, BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD) </p><br><p>  The <code>include</code> keyword allows users to dynamically create CI / CD pipelines, including external files in the configuration.  Previously, this was only possible for files in the project repository or for remote files uploaded via HTTP. </p><br><p>  With GitLab 11.7, include your configuration snippets also from other projects and from predefined templates.  GitLab will include fragments for specific jobs, such as <code>sast</code> or <code>dependency_scanning</code> , so users can refer to them instead of copying the current definition.
