The device itself is a small, fat tablet with quite strict forms by today's standards, without any smooth transitions, except for rounded corners. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/di/cm/kg/dicmkgaoafneggj9ihg1kpti_du.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7s/30/i1/7s30i1i5cbq1trhtkhtaxnsw15k.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pt/dp/wq/ptdpwq257iulz6aveqie6sshg9g.jpeg"><br><br>  The T102 had a round fingerprint sensor on top of the logo, while the T103 had virgin purity of the backside lines with almost nothing broken except for a small “seam” of the folding stand. <br><br>  Under the cover is hidden slot for a micro SD memory card, you can increase the amount of data storage by 128 GB. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/if/ck/au/ifckauwiwz-qdc0r3kkxeu3iw6o.jpeg"><br><br>  The stand leans back 170 degrees, so the device can be stably laid out on a table or on your knees with a slight slope. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ip/bo/jn/ipbojn2x3usvskotw-dureq-y7s.jpeg"><br><br>  At the bottom there are contacts and positioning holes for connecting the docking station. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/y7/ju/zu/y7juzulynkynomrn1idrfvv8she.jpeg"><br><br>  On the right is a speaker grid, volume buttons and a micro HDMI connector. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pk/nm/5z/pknm5zcoouyel1suys5iti3spwg.jpeg"><br><br>  And to the left is another speaker, micro USB, USB 3.0 and a combined audio jack. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/t6/4o/ef/t64oeffhkdqwcomtygwvtvlg0d4.jpeg"><br><br>  Not far from the volume buttons on the upper end is the power button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jp/kh/zk/jpkhzkqlunqmhcksq_5_yakuje0.jpeg"><br><br>  Plastic docking station outside is covered with velvety to the touch synthetic material. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rh/6v/ub/rh6vubyx1cen4a9yeuu0pemovwe.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2k/p0/ne/2kp0nei5uoqx6j2dywrcds0qvhu.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lh/vu/u-/lhvuu-yuxkssd4fqwjxwvylcofq.jpeg"><br><br>  On the side of the docking station there is an eyelet for the included ASUS Pen stylus.  Please note that near the mount to the transformer, the docking station has a kind of “bending”, bend.  Thanks to the built-in magnets, the docking station can be "spread out" horizontally or raised with a slight ergonomic tilt.  So much easier to type a lot of text. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5o/2p/v8/5o2pv8cs-blx4zjzobdkunkg2qk.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ex/op/fo/exopfolktqjme6cwgahsmwak4xk.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ls/qo/hq/lsqohqbalsgmmz-r6j5rhi2d_30.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uj/nj/nz/ujnjnzgdi334iimjcl83cxn4une.jpeg"><br><br>  The keyboard unit is quite strongly sunk into the docking station, and on three sides a pronounced roller is formed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tu/da/ak/tudaakvmkd2dettzt1axbmxtyue.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dw/8o/_c/dw8o_cp4odqq8z-l9tlbxzxl-vc.jpeg"><br><br>  The touchpad is also made slightly recessed, so that you can feel the orientation within its borders.  This is very important, since the transformer is very compact, and the touchpad is also small. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ia/na/wl/ianawla6wtkytgcvb7s0w7u0vsq.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  Display </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/y9/eg/0f/y9eg0fs5qfdbdgpxdysyve1-xh8.jpeg"><br><br>  Transformer Mini T103HAF is equipped with a display with a diagonal of 10.1 inches, a maximum brightness of 400 cd / m2 and a resolution of 1280x800 - as in T102HA.  And although in both cases IPS-matrices are used, however, the T103 has a wider color coverage: 60% NTSC instead of 45%.  The display is touch-sensitive, and therefore the entire front part is covered with a glossy protective glass.  In addition, input is supported using the bundled active stylus, equipped with two buttons and recognizing up to 1024 degrees of depression (in this instance, the stylus "played", so I attach a photo from <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/asus/blog/290641/">another review</a> ). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/y1/nt/au/y1ntaujj3kq8iauseifl-amndnk.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  Sound </h2><br>  Another difference T103 from T102 is the support of proprietary technology ASUS SonicMaster.  In particular, two 5-magnetic loudspeakers with quite decent volume and sound quality are used here.  It seems to me that any T103 smartphone will give a head start in terms of “external” sound. <br><br><h2>  Performance </h2><br>  The transformer is based on the <a href="https://ark.intel.com/ru/products/87383/Intel-Atom-x5-Z8300-Processor-2M-Cache-up-to-1_84-GHz">Intel Atom x5-z8300</a> quad-core processor (Cherry Trail family).  RAM 2 or 4 GB LPDDR3.  The data storage uses built-in flash memory with a capacity of 64 or 128 GB. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/j0/rl/bh/j0rlbh52qygz6qrd0b0pla5qshs.png"><br><br>  And in addition, you can insert a micro SD memory card for another 128 GB.  As the video subsystem, an integrated graphics chip Intel HD Graphics is used, which uses the main RAM for its work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xu/k2/f4/xuk2f41nsmlxrrfq0le2bfszjba.png"><br><br>  Another difference between the T103HAF and the T102HA is the <b>optional</b> presence of a 3G / LTE module.  Unfortunately, in my copy it was not, so it was not possible to test. <br><br>  Since the transformer is actually a tablet with a removable keyboard, and besides with a diagonal of only 10 inches, the layout is very dense, and there are no hot components — there is no room for an active cooling system, the transformer is cooled passively.  This is the reason for the choice of the “cold”, but not the fastest iron, primarily the processor.  Nevertheless, T103HAF runs briskly under Windows 10, flips through sites with lots of ryushes and ribbons without problems, reproduces Full HD video without brakes (although there is no sense in this at a resolution of 1280x800).  The cloud version of Photoshop worked fine, 25-megapixel photos were edited "with a bang." <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Benchmarks</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/g2/2h/gm/g22hgm5esmaebaoiqjgead1fgp8.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wm/mc/9x/wmmc9x-l-jj5zhal_gyfysohelw.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zd/sn/uw/zdsnuwty5zefebqzfxxodvva3dq.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cp/vw/ga/cpvwgabbfpoy_wn7uzgpionbhla.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/f_/dq/0r/f_dq0r83-rxlwdid_amxl41xcq4.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ls/m2/ux/lsm2uxvzexdw94zh0qq0ht7ysbe.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l9/ev/pu/l9evpunrsapg0v2gb4vvyivi8ei.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kq/h3/yd/kqh3ydh2f8lkyyjf4zqaumnf2-0.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ez/f3/qs/ezf3qsdvxg_pnwqcwdzjahru7kw.png"><br></div></div><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  The ASUS Transformer Mini (T103HAF) is a “every day” compact computer that fits in any bag, including a children's backpack.  Unpretentious and reliable docking station is removed in one motion, and the transformer turns into a tablet with a full-fledged "desktop" OS.  There are no moving parts in the device - fans or hard drives - this increases reliability.  The removable docking station and stand, which flips to a large angle, allow you to use the T103 anywhere, putting it on the table, on your knees, on your backpack, on the lawn, or just holding it up.  Someone stylus will be useful not only for its intended purpose - to draw and mark on various layouts and schemes - but also to control the gadget itself.  Although I did not have any difficulties in the tablet mode, I always got buttons and icons, but if I need to select and copy / cut / paste pieces of text, then it would be more convenient with the stylus.  In addition, the "electronic marker" is convenient for entertaining children: you can open a blank page or upload an image for coloring, and let them do it. </div>
