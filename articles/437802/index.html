  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Innovate Cloud Technology: Disaster Protection Cloud</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The cloud services market is growing rapidly both in the world and in Russia.  More and more companies are moving their applications and data, including business-critical, to the cloud.  According to marketers, this allows businesses to use the latest innovative cloud solutions, reducing capital costs (transferring CAPEX to OPEX), bringing new products to the market faster and launching new services.  And such arguments do not leave indifferent potential customers.  It is not by chance that the growth rates of the Russian cloud market significantly outpace the growth of the traditional, classic IT infrastructure market. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/798/d7e/39a/798d7e39a9870fffd5c83959e4eb9159.png"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Gradually dispel doubts about the reliability and safety of clouds.  As a recent <a href="https://ru.linxdatacenter.com/press-room/smi-about-us/issledovanie-iks-consulting-dolya-dokhodov-kommercheskikh-tsodov-ot-predostavleniya-oblachnykh-uslug/">study by iKS-Consulting has</a> shown, almost 40% of the polled Russian companies see the use of public clouds as an opportunity to increase the security of their IT systems.  The most popular infrastructure cloud service is the rental of virtual servers.  In the second place in popularity is the cloud backup service (Backup-as-a-Service).  About a third of respondents use cloud services to host storage and DR infrastructure. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e15/4f5/c7b/e154f5c7b31997adb30517cd6998b14c.png"></div><br>  Meanwhile, with the increasing dependence of business on IT requirements for the reliability of IT services, including cloud services, are growing.  Moreover, it is often necessary to ensure not only hardware reliability, but also disaster recovery. <br><br>  <a href="https://emea.emc.com/microsites/2011/emc-brs-survey/index.htm%3Fpid%3Dpress-release-brs-112311">According to research</a> , almost three-quarters of organizations in the world are not completely sure that they can restore their systems and data.  Unplanned downtime and data loss cost organizations around the world more than $ 1.7 billion annually.  According to <a href="https://newsdesk.pcmag.ru/node/40301">an Acronis study</a> , in Russia only 2% of the surveyed companies are absolutely sure that their IT infrastructure will pass any test.  Half of Russian experts expect long interruptions in its work in the event of a disaster or accident.  According to world statistics, 93% of companies that have lost their data center for only 10 days are ruined during the year. <br><br>  Accidents are unavoidable in any technically complex systems, but they can be made not critical for business.  To prevent such situations, disaster-resistant cluster systems are created, virtually eliminating downtime in the event of accidents and failures. <br><br>  Another important point that should not be forgotten when designing a disaster-proof IT infrastructure is the workplaces of users.  You need to resume business processes, and not just switch to a backup server or raise the database.  Disaster resistance begins at the client‚Äôs office.  Even a backup office with employee jobs is not the best option.  A good solution could be virtual desktops (VDI) or other forms of workplace in the cloud.  Access to such a workplace in a virtual machine in the data center is easy to organize from any computer in the branch network. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Innovations in the cloud</font> </h2><br>  The Russian telecommunications operator <a href="http://www.mastertel.ru/">MasterTel</a> and Lenovo have jointly prepared and implemented a disaster <a href="https://icloudtech.ru/">recovery</a> cloud project called <a href="https://icloudtech.ru/">Innovate Cloud Technology</a> .  Based on this cloud, highly reliable IaaS services are provided to a wide range of customers who would like to deploy critical IT infrastructure in the cloud environment.  The basis of the cloud was the metro cluster, spaced between two sites - DataPro data centers and IX—Åellerate in Moscow. <br><br>  When choosing a partner for this project, MasterTel was guided, first of all, by the vendor‚Äôs ability to promptly provide the most complete solution for reasonable money.  To implement the cloud, launched in October 2018, a team of specialists from Lenovo Professional Services was involved.  MasterTel acts as a cloud service provider (Cloud Service Provider) and a telecommunications operator that organizes secure communication channels and provides direct fiber optic lines, is responsible for the operation of the cloud and its support. <br><br>  Innovate Cloud Technology is a private cloud for corporate clients, offering highly reliable and real-time scalable cloud services IaaS, BaaS, DRaaS, VDS, etc.  What does the use of services Innovate Cloud Technology? <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">High reliability</font> </h2><br>  Currently, most cloud projects, in fact, provide power for rent.  As a rule, this is the creation of virtual servers (the most common commercial data center service in Russia) and access to an already formed pool of resources.  In the case of Innovate Cloud Technology, all settings can be made by the customer online, resources are allocated and released dynamically and pay-after-the-fact, exclusively for the resources used, as befits a classic cloud service. <br><br>  But perhaps the most important feature of Innovate Cloud Technology is high reliability.  Customers can use high-availability cloud infrastructure and store highly critical data in geographically separated DataPro and IXCellerate data centers.  These sites by themselves guarantee reliability and a high level of physical and information security.  A reliable high-speed communication channels and access to both data centers provides MasterTel. <br><br>  Innovate Cloud Technology is a cloud resource with guaranteed availability of 99.99% for SLA.  However, this cloud is distinguished not only by high reliability, but also by disaster recovery, since this is a geographically distributed virtualization cluster at two sites of the Tier III level. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">DataPro Data Center</font> </h2><br>  This data center Tier III on the street.  Aviamotornaya in Moscow is one of the few Russian commercial data centers that have been certified by Uptime Design and Facility.  All technologies and solutions used in the data center are certified, which means maximum fault tolerance, guaranteed availability of resources and is an insurance against unexpected situations. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/af1/ad1/410/af1ad1410fd20f4b0d2d802f9a68fe6b.png"></div><br>  DataPro Data Center Control Center.  International certification of Uptime Design and Facility means that it is designed and built in accordance with all applicable standards for the Tier III reliability category. <br>  Security is responsible for the security of the data center and the surrounding area.  The security system includes more than 350 network cameras.  For uninterrupted and uninterrupted power supply, uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) are used, diesel generator sets (DGS) are used, which support the work of the data center during a long-term power outage. <br><br>  In the DataPro data center - two independent inputs of 10 kV from the Mosenergo substation, and the cables are laid in different collectors, provide the supply of the necessary electrical power to the object.  The power supply of the data center is actually reserved under the 2N scheme. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">IXcellerate Moscow One</font> </h2><br>  IXcellerate's Moscow One data center also has a Tier III Uptime Institute certificate in the Design category.  The facility also corresponds to the Level 3 reliability level in the categories ‚Äúproject‚Äù, ‚Äúconstruction‚Äù and ‚Äúoperation‚Äù according to the IBM Reliability Rating System methodology.  IXcellerate Moscow One is technically implemented and guaranteed at the level of SLA with an availability indicator of 99.999%.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe IXcellerate Moscow One data center in Degunino is 15,741 square meters.  The design capacity of the facility reaches 13.7 MW.  Data center customers - about a hundred international and Russian companies. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/88d/815/21c/88d81521cac466b744861f91247761a5.png"></div><br>  Passing certification tests of the Uptime Institute proves that the IXcellerate computer complex is designed in accordance with modern world practices of building data centers. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Disaster tolerance</font> </h2><br>  Distribution over two sites requires the organization of redundant communication channels, replication of data between storages.  We need a data synchronization mechanism to ensure their relevance in case of failure of one of the nodes and to support the work of those information systems that need such synchronization. <br><br>  Often at the heart of disaster-resistant data center - geographically distributed cluster configuration of servers with connection to a common storage area network (SAN).  The nodes of such a separated cluster are located on the main and backup sites, forming a single system.  This ensures continuous availability of services even in case of loss of one of the data center.  Using clustering, you can automatically switch the load between sites of a distributed data center in the event of an accident. <br><br>  Data storage systems at the indicated sites can completely duplicate each other, and the sites themselves connect with redundant high-speed communication channels, which allows realizing projects with the highest demands on the reliability of data transfer and their availability, including synchronous data replication. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/998/93c/0a5/99893c0a5518c8fd12dcb5b43df1fa4d.png"></div><br>  VMware vSphere based metro cluster example.  it is based on the duplication of storage systems at two geographically separated sites with data replication and possible load balancing at the data center network level.  When one of the data centers is unavailable, the virtual machines will be automatically launched on the second platform.  The metrocluster is almost zero idle, work is interrupted only during the launch of virtual machines, when VMware High Availability (HA) restarts the VM on the remote site with the storage system that is in the cluster. <br><br>  If you use load balancing mechanisms for DR (Global Server Load Balancing, GSLB), you can automatically switch users to the backup site when the primary fails.  For users, this process will be transparent. <br><br>  Unlike DR with data replication, in the case of a metro cluster, only the same disk types are used for mirroring, an identical configuration is needed at both sites. <br><br>  The cloud of Innovate Cloud Technology based on VMware is built according to this scheme.  It provides continuous operation of critical applications and data in the cloud.  All elements of the virtualization cluster are duplicated on two sites, which are almost 30 km apart.  Between them, data is mirrored at the storage system level.  Due to this, data and services will be available in case of failures on one of the sites: power outages, partial storage system failure, controllers, communication channels between the data center, and even if one of the sites is completely inoperable. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/423/0fb/42f/4230fb42f6a9fb7bdad9ef575a9fadec.png"></div><br>  When one of the data centers is unavailable, virtual machines are migrated to a backup site.  Running a virtual machine on a backup site (Recovery Time Objective, RTO) will take about 3 minutes. <br><br>  Customers are offered a detailed Service Level Agreement (SLA).  Its main indicators: service availability at the level of 99.99%;  idle time - no more than 4.38 minutes per month, guaranteed parameters of processor performance (MIPS / 1 vCPU), disk system (IOPS, GB / s), delay in accessing the storage system.  For their compliance provider is financially responsible. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Anatomy of the metrocluster</font> </h2><br>  The cloud was built according to the classical architectural model, which involves the purchase of all the necessary hardware and software: servers with physical and logical access, storage, network components, virtualization software, security solutions. <br><br>  In two data centers in Moscow, the allocated closed zones on four racks with computing and network nodes are organized.  The solution is built on Lenovo-made components.  The 1U Lenovo ThinkSystem SR530 / SR570 / SR630 servers with Emulex 16Gb Gen6 FC Dual-Port HBA adapters are used as hardware computing systems, Lenovo Storage V3700 V2 XP arrays are used for data storage, and 10-Gbps 32-port rack switches for data storage with Lenovo ThinkSystem NE1032 RackSwitch.  The package includes factory-installed VMware ESXi 6.5 software on servers.  Sites are connected by two 8 Gb / s FC channels and two 10 Gb / s Ethernet channels. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bc6/933/191/bc69331918aee301a1a40f994574a237.png"></div><br>  The structure of a geographically distributed cluster.  The metro cluster located between two sites provides disaster recovery and makes it possible to provide reliable IaaS services to a wide range of customers.  Sites are connected by redundant Ethernet (2x10 Gbit / s) and FC (2x8 Gbit / s) channels. <br><br>  Due to the acquisition of infrastructure components from one supplier, the reliability and resiliency of the entire complex is increased, conflicts between elements, standards and protocols are eliminated. <br><br>  The joint efforts of the two teams carried out work on the creation of the project, the preparation and elaboration of the TZ, the installation of equipment, the commissioning, the stress testing and the launch of the metrocluster into operation. <br><br>  Lenovo Metrocluster provides full backup of all its elements: servers, storage, controllers, FC-adapters, optical switches.  Synchronous data replication at the storage level provides a Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of zero. <br><br>  High availability has always been achieved by ensuring redundancy - this is also true in the case of preparation for extreme situations, when the entire data center must be protected from power outages or natural disasters.  If one of the sites fails, the geographically dispersed cluster automatically switches to the second data center without interrupting the workflows.  In essence, a metrocluster is a local cluster with a mirrored storage system, spaced between two sites. <br><br>  Geographically distributed clusters do not have critical points of failure.  In the metrocluster, mutual synchronous data replication between sites is implemented.  When a problem occurs, switching to another site is completely transparent and without administrator intervention.  Automation of this process ensures continuous operation of all applications.  Metro clusters also do not need to be stopped in order to upgrade their hardware or software. <br><br>  For example, if the entire server fails, its responsibilities within a few seconds go to the second server located on the same site.  Short-term data input / output interruption in this case will not affect the operation of the applications, since the data is synchronously mirrored to the second site.  If there is a problem with the switch, cable or HBA-Fiber Channel adapter, backup switching to the second data center will not be required, and the end user will not experience any decrease in application performance. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c3f/668/355/c3f6683556f3fc49f8d82dadcea61987.png"></div><br>  In the event of a failure of the entire service node, a short-term (several seconds) interruption of I / O flows occurs: services are first transferred to neighboring nodes, and the need to switch to a remotely located node occurs only if the site is completely disrupted. <br><br>  In this situation, a geographically distributed cluster uses redundancy at the data center level to overcome the failure, and the systems located on the second site assume the support of all services.  Thus, application servers retain access to all services, but with limited performance. <br><br>  When the site on which the failure occurred re-enters the operating mode, it will be necessary to transfer to it only the data that was changed during the idle time, so after the local problems have been fixed, the affected data center can return to normal operation very quickly. <br><br>  In case of loss of VMware hosts, High Availability (HA) immediately restarts the VM on the remote site.  If one of the storage systems fails, the storage system on the other site announces the paths to the disks to the remaining hosts.  The lost VMs are restarted on them, everything happens automatically. <br>  If the connection between the sites is lost, then everything continues to work in its place and, as soon as the connection is restored, the synchronization process begins. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">The composition of the decision</font> </h2><table><tbody><tr><td width="390">  Eight Lenovo ThinkSystem SR630 servers with 2 Intel Xeon Gold 6132 14C 140W 2.6 GHz processors, 32 GB TruDDR4 2666 MHz memory (RDIMM), 10 bays for 2.5 "drives, M.2 32 GB SATA SSD and factory-installed VMware ESXi 6.5. <br></td><td>  Dual-processor server in the 1U form factor has the flexibility and performance due to the support of hard drives and solid-state drives (HDD and SSD) with SAS or SATA interfaces (12 SFF or 4 LFF).
