Although if it is paid (from schoolchildren donations or working for an idea?), Then why not)) ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/fbk/blog/347312/">-112</a> ) </blockquote><br>  Or a comment from a company representative (?): <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Expand</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>  Hello!  I would like to comment on this situation: <br><br>  The largest Russian registrar REG.RU terminated the contract with Beget LLC <br>  (St. Petersburg) due to systematic violations of the terms of the contract and the Domain Name Registration Rules in effect in the national .RU / .–†–§ domains. <br><br>  REG.RU is concerned about the quality of work of the former intermediary, as well as the safety of user data and serviceability of services. <br><br>  The actions of Beget LLC, testifying to the abuse of the rights of the mediator of the accredited registrar and violation of the laws of the Russian Federation, established: <br><br>  - non-compliance with the law on the protection of personal data (FZ-152) in terms of collection, processing and storage; <br>  - massive gross systematic violations of the Rules for registration of domain names acting in the national domains .RU / .–†–§ and the conditions of the agreement concluded between the registrar and the partner; <br>  - unfair competition by misleading domain administrators. <br><br>  In connection with the situation that has arisen, we undertake direct interaction with the administrators on the maintenance of domain names registered in REG.RU, like an accredited registrar (these changes affected about 50 thousand customers). <br><br>  Domain name administrators are not required to perform any actions - all necessary operations were performed by REG.RU.  All the necessary information is sent to the contact e-mail addresses of users. <br><br>  At the moment, REG.RU company is preparing information to apply to the relevant control organizations for the purpose of conducting audits of Beget LLC‚Äôs activities for compliance with the requirements of a bona fide civil turnover participant and an accredited registrar to prevent further damage to third parties. <br><br>  For any questions, customers can contact the dedicated support line by email partners_bgt@reg.ru or by phone +7 (499) 7025373. <br><br>  In accordance with well-established business practices in the domain name registration system and in accordance with the requirements of an accredited registrar, accredited registrars are required to monitor the operation of the partner network, empower and revoke permissions to interact with domain name administrators and prevent violations. <br><br>  In connection with the attempt of a number of individuals to create a negative background (including in various Internet publications) around the situation with the termination of the registrar‚Äôs contractual relationship with the intermediary Beget, we are taking measures to protect our customers. <br><br>  We fear that the dissemination of false information may lead to misleading registrar users, as well as multiple hijacking of domain names. <br>  In order to counter theft or other illegal actions in respect of user domains, we, in accordance with the powers granted to the registrar, verify the data when transferring the domain name to another registrar.  We remind you that maintaining the accuracy of the data contained in the registry is the direct responsibility of the registrar, and the provision of false information is a violation of the terms of service.  ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/poiskvps/blog/413553/">-89</a> ) </blockquote><br><blockquote>  Providing more detailed information is currently not possible, due to the forthcoming appeal to the relevant regulatory organizations.

Even if Russia is the first here, the more its expansion will be in other countries, the sooner this issue will arise among local special services.  The closest candidates are Germany, France and Britain, who do not know firsthand what terrorism is. <br>  The problem is solved, albeit not in the manner prescribed by law.  The only question is when the compromise will be announced.  Divide the "telegram" the fate of the ruckraker or continue to work, depends only on its creator.

You see all these decisions in black light.  Been reading some Navalny, or even some gosdepovskogo agent who want the collapse of Russia.  But Putin is a more far-sighted politician than you think.  Do not be Putin, on Russia would continue to wipe his feet all and sundry.  He understands what the enemies of Russia are capable of.  Russia's cyber frontiers need protection no less than physical borders.  On that site they brought a clumsy wording "switch for disconnecting Russia from the Internet."  If you carefully read, it is not meant.  But even if it is, is it really that bad, in the face of an external threat?  This would protect the critical infrastructure from outside intrusions.  Nobody says that this switch will be used all the time.  As for the foreign Internet, you need to understand that now we are dependent on it.  Do not allow internal traffic through external channels is a logical decision.  If some company works in Russia, interacts with Russian citizens, then it must host the server in Russia and, of course, comply with Russian laws.  If the company is not ready to comply with Russian laws (for some technical or financial reasons), then the way to Russia should be closed to it.
