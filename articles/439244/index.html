A bill is already ready, according to which domestic software should be a condition for the release of devices on the Russian market.  According to experts, Yandex will benefit from the new rules, which can save tens of millions of dollars a year on commercial contracts with vendors.  Foreign companies are predictably not very happy with the initiative. <br><br>  The project became known after the FAS forwarded to the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media a draft of amendments to the laws ‚ÄúOn Communications‚Äù and ‚ÄúOn Information‚Äù.  According to the project, manufacturers of smartphones, tablets and computers can be forced to pre-install domestic software on their products.  Only in this case, gadgets will fall on the Russian market. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In addition, the bill states that equipment manufacturers should provide for the complete removability of foreign pre-installed applications, in the event that this software does not affect the functioning of the equipment.  The list of devices on which it is necessary to install domestic software, the list of types of such software and the procedure for creating and maintaining the registry are established by the government. <br><br>  At the end of January, the FAS prepared the concept of the bill, according to which domestic software means a browser, antivirus, a geo-program and a messenger installed on smartphones, tablets, laptops and desktops weighing up to 10 kg. <br><br>  Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said that creating an alternative to foreign products does not mean that Russia decided to take the path of self-isolation.  This is impossible and inappropriate. <br><br>  According to the head of FAS, Anatoly Golomolzin, all subscriber equipment in Russia is subject to certification.  "Compliance with the requirements for pre-installation and uninstallation of applications that do not affect the performance of the devices will be one of the conditions for the certification of such equipment," he said.  Representatives of the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media stated that the approach is interesting, but it should be worked out both from a technical and economic point of view. <br><br>  In order to undergo a compliance procedure, devices are subjected to a series of tests.  They are conducted by standards.  But there is no standard to confirm the conditions of the pre-installation and the uninstallation of applications and software.  And until they appear, the requirements of the FAS, prescribed in the bill, will be impossible to implement.  Well, one can wait for the emergence of new standards for a long time - this is not a matter of one month. <br><br>  According to experts, the FAS initiative may have a negative impact on foreign companies.  And Apple will suffer most of all, since almost all of the company's gadgets are managed by a closed operating platform.  As a class, it lacks certain categories of applications - for example, antiviruses.  So if the bill is adopted, the share of Apple in the Russian market may significantly decrease. <br><br>  Well, ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù will win, because it will get its applications pre-installed on hundreds of thousands of devices almost for free.  Now the company has to pay manufacturers, and out of 35 million smartphones sold annually in Russia, there are 18 million applications of the company. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt is important that the technical details of any new regulation be carefully worked out.  Of course, existing commercial agreements with manufacturers must be maintained.  Also, the user experience and safety of devices should not suffer, ‚Äùsaid Yandex. <br><br>  Earlier it <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/437384/">was</a> also <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/437384/">reported</a> that from a certain point on, Russian officials would be transferred to mobile devices based on Sailfish OS.  The project to provide the authorities with new devices was prepared in early 2018.  The supplier of such phones will be Rostelecom, which has developed two models for the provision of mobile communication services based on the domestic operating system.  The first model, in fact, rent, the rate is 16.6 thousand rubles per person per year.  Most likely, the full transition of federal employees to the domestic OS will take place by the end of 2021.  In 2019, the number of officials with new phones will grow to 300 thousand, in 2020 to 800, by the end of 2021, to 1.4 million people. <br><br>  Financing the program ‚ÄúRussian smartphones for Russian officials‚Äù will cost the budget 1.3 billion rubles this year alone. <br><br><blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jy/sd/rr/jysdrr7tqgfjt50wtcshw89ctho.png" align="left"><h3>  Minute of care from UFO </h3><br>  This material could cause contradictory feelings, so before writing a comment, refresh something important in your memory: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How to write a comment and survive</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  Do not write abusive comments, do not go to the person. </li><li>  Refrain from using obscene language and toxic behavior (even in a veiled form). </li><li>  To report comments that violate the rules of the site, use the "Report" button (if available) or <a href="https://habr.com/feedback/%3Ftype%3D4">a feedback form</a> . </li></ul><br>  What to do if: <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/karma/">minus karma</a> |  <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/sandbox/">blocked account</a> <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/other/">Code of authors Habra</a> and <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/other/">habraetiket</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/rules/">Full site rules</a> </div></div></blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/439244/">https://habr.com/ru/post/439244/</a></p>
