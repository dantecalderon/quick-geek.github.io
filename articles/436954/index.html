Where?  When? ‚Äù, But much more fun and takes place in cafes and bars.  All that is needed for the game - a little bit of knowledge from a little bit from everywhere, levity and courage, and, of course, the team.  If you do not have a team, you will find a place in another - just write in the ‚Äú <a href="https://vk.com/etomozgvadetka">Brain search</a> ‚Äù or directly to the organizers.  This is a great reason to make new friends. </li></ul><br><p>  There are also games for beginners, with simple questions and without experienced rivals.  The most is to try. </p><br><p>  How is the game: </p><br><ul><li>  2, 5 hours. </li><li>  from 2 to 9 people in the team. </li><li>  39 questions. </li><li>  7 rounds: musical, cinema, about Russia and the CIS, about the facts, a blitz tour, a difficult tour ‚ÄúThe Market of the Brain‚Äù and a surprise tour. <a name="habracut"></a></li></ul><br><p>  <a href="https://thebell.io/vstrechi-bellclub/mihail-kuchment-v-bellclub">Michael Kuchment at BellClub</a> </p><br><ul><li>  <strong>January 23 (Wednesday)</strong> </li><li>  New Square 6 </li><li>  10 000 r. </li><li>  The first guest of BellClub in 2019 will be the co-owner, head of the supervisory board of Sovcombank and the founder of the furniture network Hoff businessman Mikhail Kuchment.  Before doing business, Mikhail made a successful managerial career, but in 2008 he decided to leave the post of commercial director of M.Video network in order to build a new retail business.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcompeting with IKEA may seem extravagant, and launching a new business in the crisis year of 2008 may be pure madness.  But in the six years since its inception, the Hoff network has increased its revenue to 26 billion rubles and entered the rating of the 500 largest companies in Russia.  More than 15% of the business now accounts for online sales. </li></ul><br><p>  <a href="http://www.cityclass.ru/hakamada_restart">Irina Khakamada.</a>  <a href="http://www.cityclass.ru/hakamada_restart">Restart</a>  <a href="http://www.cityclass.ru/hakamada_restart">Reboot!</a> </p><br><ul><li>  <strong>January 23 (Wednesday)</strong> </li><li>  Garnet lane.  7c1 </li><li>  3 250 r. </li><li>  Irina Khakamada offers you her experience and knowledge: she will tell about her own successful and uncomplicated projects, about her restart button, sources of inspiration and energy, about her motivation and how to start everything all over again! </li></ul><br><p>  <a href="https://product-meetup-events.timepad.ru/event/884858/">Product MeetUP # 4</a> </p><br><ul><li>  <strong>January 24 (Thursday)</strong> </li><li>  Gun lane 41 </li><li>  is free </li><li>  Grocery mitap on web and mobile analytics.
