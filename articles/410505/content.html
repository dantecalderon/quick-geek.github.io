<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/as/pz/5m/aspz5mbpogugu73zkse7zjlczqg.jpeg"><br><br>  The German automaker Porsche, together with a Berlin startup XIAN, is testing blockchain applications that are integrated directly into the computers of their cars.  This makes the Stuttgart-based company the world's first car manufacturer to introduce and test the use of the blockchain in the automotive industry. <br><br>  Blockchain-based transactions are safe and fast.  The applications tested by the company include: locking and unlocking the carâ€™s doors using the application, temporary access authorizations, as well as encrypted registration of information.  In the future, these developments may find new applications in the development of autonomous driving functions. <br><br><h3>  Fast and secure services </h3><br>  Developed on the basis of blockchain services work quickly and safely.  The machine becomes part of the blockchain and establishes a direct offline connection without the mediation of any servers.  The process of unlocking and locking the car takes only 1.6 seconds, which is six times faster than before.  In addition, cryptographic encryption is used.  This process means that any actions with the machine are recorded in the blockchain in such a way that the record of them cannot be changed, but can be viewed using the application.  The car owner can at any time issue or revoke access to the car of third parties, as well as follow the actions of such authorized users using secure digital technology. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The use of blockchain allows you to establish a secure connection to the data store about the car and its functional features.  At the same time, the protection extends to any communication between the parties.  Third-party services can be integrated without the need for additional hardware solutions, thanks to the integration of smart contracts. <br><br><h3>  New blockchain-based business models </h3><br>  Porsche is also working on new blockchain-based business models.  As part of the new project, the company is working on a system for registering information that allows locally to encrypt the processed data and send it to a distributed blockchain, which can be audited later.  Users will always maintain control over the data and the ability to make decisions about their use depending on the situation.  All actions are recorded in the blockchain and data deletion becomes transparent.  These developments can serve as a basis for improving autonomous driving systems: cars will use local data to obtain regional learning patterns that will be transmitted from other cars via a secure channel. <br><br><h3>  XAIN Information </h3><br>  Startup XAIN won the first Porsche Innovation Contest in the blockchain category last summer.  The project has surpassed more than a hundred other competitors.  After the competition, XAIN together with various interdisciplinary teams Porsche for three months worked on the creation and testing of applications.  Blockchain development was introduced into the Panamera model using an energy efficient mining process developed in XAIN.  Currently, Porsche is working on other technology applications, including charging and parking. <br><br>  XAIN offers various solutions in the field of artificial intelligence and blockchain, with a focus on intelligent industrial applications.  The founders of Leaf-Nissen Lundback and Felix Hamann are particularly active in the automotive industry, where both professionals began their careers.  Together with researchers from the University of Oxford and Imperial College London, XAIN has worked over the past few years to create a blockchain system that significantly reduces energy consumption for mining.  This means that the XAIN solution is suitable for mobile devices and cars. <br><br><h3>  Data on the consumption of resources during the test </h3><br>  Model Range Panamera: Combined fuel consumption: 9.5 - 6.7 liters per 100 km.
