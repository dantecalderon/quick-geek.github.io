Translator</font></i> ) and from the engine.  Also, the country refuses to build new nuclear power plants. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The authorities want to popularize cars on ecological fuel through subsidies and an increase in the number of corresponding gas stations.  In addition, the cost of the hydrogen fuel itself should be reduced.  Fuel cell vehicles sales are planned to increase from 700 units per year in 2015 to 4,000 units per year in 2019. <br><br><h2>  Hydrogen economy </h2><br>  The new plan of the South Korean government was called the ‚Äúhydrogen economy‚Äù.  Until 2018, approximately 2,000 electric vehicles were produced in the country in which hydrogen technology is used to convert electricity into electric energy instead ( <i><font color="#0e4378">Hyundai ix35 FCEV and Toyota Mirai are considered one of the most popular in the world - approx. Translator</font></i> ).  According to the new plan, until 2025 the number of hydrogen cars in the country should increase to 100 thousand units. <br><br>  Until 2040, a further sharp increase in production is planned ( <i><font color="#0e4378">probably due to the number of cars produced from 2019 to 2040 - approx. Translator</font></i> ): up to 6.2 million fuel cell vehicles, 3.3 million of which will be exported. <br><br>  The increase in the number of hydrogen cars in the country is planned to be achieved by expanding the infrastructure - an increase in the corresponding gas stations from 14 units in 2018 to 310 units to 2022 and 1,200 units to 2040. <br><br><h2>  Price issue </h2><br>  In addition, it is planned to reduce the average price of a hydrogen car to about 27 thousand euros at the expense of subsidies ( <i><font color="#0e4378">binding to the euro, probably due to the fact that most electric fuel cell vehicles are exported to Europe - comment of the translator</font></i> ).  Hydrogen should also be significantly cheaper: the goal is to reduce the cost of hydrogen production from 6.25 to 2.34 euros per kg by 2040. <br><br>  Public and commercial transport is also expected to be converted to hydrogen.  The long-term goal is to commission 40,000 buses, 80,000 taxis, and 30,000 fuel cell trucks and stimulate domestic production of components and spare parts. <br><br><h2>  NPP, RES and CHP </h2><br>  The plan also states that South Korea will not be building new nuclear power plants on its territory in the coming years, as they may pose a greater risk in the event of an accident, as, for example, happened in 2011 in Japan at the Fukushima nuclear power plant.  Instead, it was decided to develop alternative energy sources and continue to use existing power plants, including nuclear power plants ( <i><font color="#0e4378">after the pessimistic government came to power in 2017, approx. Translator</font></i> ). <br><br>  There are 4 nuclear power plants in South Korea with 24 nuclear reactors that produce 22.5 GW of energy.  Nuclear power accounts for 27% of total electricity production, about 70% is produced in thermal power plants that burn coal, gas or fuel oil and seriously pollute the atmosphere. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/om/n7/kg/omn7kgqdregzcuwbcharvxe6m3i.jpeg"><br>  <i>Wolson NPP on the coast of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãJapan in the vicinity of Gyeongju, Gyeongsang Province.</i> <br><br>  Earlier it was reported that South Korea plans to create a zone of renewable energy.  This is a project to create a zone for the development of solar and wind energy, where it is planned to produce up to 4 GW of electricity.  The plan is designed for 20 years. <br><br><hr><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">From the translator:</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  tried to ‚Äúsmooth corners‚Äù and clarify some concepts and figures given in the original article </li><li>  the authors' opinion that ‚Äúelectric vehicle‚Äù and ‚Äúfuel cell vehicle‚Äù are different concepts, I do not share.
