<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  With the growth of the project, the compilation speed of the project slows down.  This becomes especially noticeable when you test a program, making small changes in the program in parallel. <br><br>  First, let's find out how long the project is compiled before our improvements.  To do this, you need to enter in the terminal <br><br><pre><code class="plaintext hljs">defaults write com.apple.dt.Xcode ShowBuildOperationDuration -bool YES</code> </pre> <br>  To do this, go to the Product section, hold down alt and click the Clean Build Folder, and then build the project again.  My project compiles <b>81 seconds</b> .  Let's see what the result will be after improvement. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ai/nn/wk/ainnwksfevq9ofpg-2kbgr0dyk8.png"><br><br>  First of all, we should know which places lead to a slower compilation.  By default, Xcode does not show a warning where the problem is, but we can fix it. <br>  The "heaviest" places are big functions and type checking.  Therefore, we need to write these two lines in the Build Settings section -&gt; Other Swift Flags -&gt; Debug <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">-Xfrontend -warn-long-function-bodies=100 -Xfrontend -warn-long-expression-type-checking=100</code> </pre> <br>  (here we have compilation time 100ms, we can put any number) <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Visual drawing</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zd/d8/tm/zdd8tmafqnt9p2oepvgnrqvqtqi.png"><br></div></div><br>  An example of my working project <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lo/fb/ml/lofbmlh_mbj0ttozv1umwgdboj4.png"><br><br>  I have a site that occupies 13778 ms, most likely you will not have this, but because of the specifics of the project, I have such sites.  Since there is built a binary tree for OCR. <br>  Because of the deep nesting in each other and the type definition only at the very beginning, before the equal sign, the compiler needs a lot of time to understand what type it is in front of it.  (The tree takes 30 lines, here is part of it) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Before</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/km/iy/gy/kmiygyrccfpgigf9jqgpb2oiap4.png"><br><br>  <b>After</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fd/hc/ip/fdhcipngcgvgs0fsxe-5zblrczi.png"><br><br>  We defined a type for each nesting and the warning was gone. <br><br>  Another weak point is several closures in a row. <br><br>  <b>Before</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wi/9z/wu/wi9zwu7ogh0thzf0qmbvlsmr_ok.png"><br><br>  <b>After</b> <br><br>  Explicitly indicated type <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cy/l6/yg/cyl6ygv4mldo_ii6oyr-jg8gtia.png"><br><br>  After fixing all the warnings, check the project build time again. <br>  Now the project is compiled <b>26 seconds</b> in two and a half times faster. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jg/se/vd/jgsevdfpysvqaztx1ncws5fzwci.png"><br><br>  There is still something to work on, but the most obvious problems have been fixed. </div>
