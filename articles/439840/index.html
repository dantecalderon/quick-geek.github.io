Usability. Management. Practice) is the largest developer conference, which has been held in Yekaterinburg since 2011.  In 2018, she gathered 1,500 people from Yekaterinburg, Chelyabinsk, Tyumen, Ufa, Kurgan, Moscow, Izhevsk, Perm and other cities. <br><br>  Last year we spoke with Grigory Bakunov (Yandex), Alexey Akulovich (VKontakte), Sergey Abdulmanov (Mosigra), Alexey Savvateev (CEMI RAS), Alexander Burt, Zarema Khalilova (Uploadcare), Alexey Migutsky (Microsoft), Seryozha Popov (HTML Academy), Oleg Anastasyev (Odnoklassniki) and 37 more cool speakers. <br><br>  All videos of last year's reports can be viewed on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/videoitpeople/playlists">YouTube channel</a> .

We will tell the theory and share the real cases of companies that are already practicing.  If you are still inventing your product "out of your head" - be sure to come, go completely updated! </li><li>  Entering foreign markets.  Success stories and failures, lifehacks and rakes.  There will be a story about how to find customers in the US and how (do not) build sales abroad. </li><li>  Developer motivation system: successful and unsuccessful cases.  If you have something to share on this topic - send a request for a report! </li><li>  Block "Psychology for tmlid".  There will be topics about professional burnout, about the role of a manager in resolving conflicts in a team, and applied - how to evaluate not only professional skills, but also personal qualities. </li></ul><br>  If you have real experience on any of these topics, and there is a fire in your chest to share it - <a href="http://dump-ekb.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_term%3Dcfp_test_design_management%26utm_content%3Dtest_design_management%26utm_campaign%3Ddump2019">write to</a> us!

Therefore, we have collected from familiar art directors and design leads topics that they themselves would like to listen to, without particularly looking at whether there is anyone to read them. <br><br>  Why did we do that?  Firstly, it is interesting to listen about what does not yet have a reliable answer - this is guaranteed to be a fresh and developing topic.  Secondly, we think that there will be people in the community who can uncover a new topic if they clearly understand that they are waiting for it. <br><br>  Will we take reports outside of these topics?  Yes of course.  But we will look exactly at this factor - as far as the topic is in the zone of the nearest development of the design community. <br><br>  So topics: <br><br><ul><li>  Creativity and aesthetics.  How to organize a learning zone at work?  How to raise the bar in aesthetics at the team / company level? </li><li>  How to develop and train designers (for design leads) and how a designer to develop himself so as not to remain an eternal strong middling. </li><li>  Artificial intelligence in the work of the designer.  Symbiosis for now and for the next 5 years. </li><li>  Facilitation of meetings by the designer - how to teach. </li><li>  Designer income: what they pay for.  Enhance models. </li><li>  Scaling a team / product.  How to preserve and transfer the culture created in a small company. </li><li>  JDTB method (field practices, method comparison). </li><li>  Design Ops in the product.  Establishing design operations to scale a product. </li><li>  Caring for the interface in a developing product. </li><li>  Service design: tools and practices. </li><li>  Work with images. </li><li>  Applied work with fonts in interfaces. </li></ul><br>  Let the descriptive and review topics pass us by.
