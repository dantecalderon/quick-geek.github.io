There is no official announcement yet, but the developers publish the <a href="https://android-review.googlesource.com/q/topic:%2522aosp_simlock_q_enhancements%2522">results of studying the</a> new OS, which do not allow to doubt the above. <br><br>  Mobile operators will be able to create lists of allowed and prohibited networks to which the phone can or cannot connect.  In this case, the phone can be forbidden to work even with the virtual operator who is the “contractor” of the user's mobile company. <br><br>  Restrictions will work with respect to dual-device devices.  Now operators can impose restrictions only on smartphones with one SIM card.
