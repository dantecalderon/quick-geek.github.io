  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Dell and Alienware at CES 2019: A Guide to All Major New Products</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Most recently, the Consumer Electronics Show 2019 exhibition ended in Las Vegas. It so happened that this is one of the main platforms for announcements of new computers.  Of course, Dell and our Alienware subsidiary could not stand aside - at CES we presented a lot of interesting technology.  And today, in short, we want to talk about all the upcoming releases.  At the same time we will try to orient in the timing of the emergence of new products in Russia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pl/sv/zo/plsvzouews6pr2wgtrjz_szizec.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#3183c1">Dell XPS 13 9380</font> </h2><br>  One of the very first Dell announcements at CES 2019 was the update of the flagship of our consumer ultrabooks.  This, of course, is about the XPS 13 model, which in 2019 received a digital index of 9380. All the key advantages are low weight, compact dimensions, a 13-inch InfinityEdge display with ultra-thin frame and various quality IPS matrices, an excellent cooling system and so on - stayed in place. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2d/tc/ta/2dtcta5wb4s08blvjaig_ywpbug.jpeg"><br><br>  What is new?  First, the engineers managed to make a webcam module so compact that in the XPS 13 9380 he was able to safely move from under the display back to the upper frame above it.  Many corporate users, who often communicate with colleagues via video link, have been waiting for this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-y/wd/ih/-ywdiha2ivstacxpm9bhso9lbm4.jpeg"><br><br>  Secondly, the gadget is now available in four colors: in addition to Rose Gold, Black and White, the Frost color has appeared, for Russia we translate it as ‚Äúsnow-white‚Äù.  He looks really cool. <br><br>  In addition, the laptop display now supports Dolby Vision HDR format.  We hope that this small step will be a significant contribution to the common cause of the ubiquitous distribution of content with a wide dynamic range.  Of course, it‚Äôs too early to talk about real mass, but, as with USB Type-C, things are gradually moving. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/39/cm/36/39cm36zfkqmnxif2mozctwdgv-c.jpeg"><br><br>  As for the "stuffing", then the new XPS 13 processors are installed Intel Core i5-8265U and i7-8565U.  They differ from the previous i5-8250U and i7-8550U by increased maximum frequencies in the Boost mode.  TDP level and other key parameters are the same.  Therefore, we believe that the upgrade will be primarily interesting to owners of XPS 13 9360 or earlier versions of the laptop. <br><br>  But that's not all.  Also appeared the third version of the XPS 13 9380: with an Intel Core i3-8145U processor.  It is dual-core, but it can perform four computation threads simultaneously and operates at frequencies from 2.1 to 3.9 GHz.  And the most interesting thing is that in the USA the minimum configuration of a model with this chip will cost $ 899.  Unfortunately, it will not be delivered to Russia at the start of sales, but we hope that over time the modification will reach our market. <br><br>  If we talk about two older versions, then about their supply everything is already decided.  Gadgets will arrive in our country by the end of February, and prices will start from 106 000 rubles.  More detailed information and accurate specifications are already <a href="https://www.dell.com/ru/p/xps-13-9380-laptop/pd%3Fref%3DPD_OC">on the Russian official website</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gi/s2/ye/gis2yem4ima41alhl1h0t9qfky4.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#3183c1">Dell Latitude 7400</font> </h2><br>  The second interesting novelty is an enterprise-class laptop <a href="https://www.dellemc.com/en-us/latitude/7400-2-in-1.htm">Latitude 7400</a> .  It has become one of the first computers in the world that support Intel Context Sensing technology.  One of the ways to apply it is to issue more relevant recommendations based on user activity on the web.  But another possibility is much more interesting: using sensors, the software is determined by the user or not.  For example, if you sit in a chair in front of a laptop, then he will start the authentication process in the system for face recognition.  And if you decide to interrupt work and go for a cup of coffee, then you should just get out of the chair, and then the system will lock itself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5t/qz/ll/5tqzlly6qlf4ietnllg0m-5hn1k.jpeg"><br><br>  In addition, the Dell Latitude 7400 is also the most compact 2-in-1 computer in our portfolio of commercial products.  The 14-inch display of the gadget can be completely folded back, turning it into a tablet.  At the same time, the device weighs less than 1.4 kilograms in basic configurations.  The matrix here, of course, is sensory and with a resolution of 1920x1080.  Full HD is chosen in order to maximize the battery life of the model.  In the version with a 78W battery, the laptop can work for up to 24 hours without connecting to the mains!  It supports fast charging technology. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tu/xb/qd/tuxbqdlbxt91rxgzl8zanawywtc.jpeg"><br><br>  The hardware component also looks interesting.  At the heart of the entire eighth generation of updated Intel processors, called Whiskey Lake - they were already discussed above in the block about XPS 13 9380. Also inside the Latitude 7400 can be installed SSD NVMe drive with up to 2 TB and up to 16 GB of RAM. <br><br>  At the ends of the gadget, there are two full-sized USB 3.0 connectors, HDMI, and two Thunderbolt 3, one of which can act as a port for charging.  There is support for NFC, FIPS 201 smart card reader. And there are still versions of Latitude 7400 with LTE modem and SIM slot. <br><br>  We are planning to bring the model to Russia for corporate customers in May.  At the moment, the estimated starting price of basic configurations is from 108,000 rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/te/we/h2/teweh20a8nadhfrnwhnfm_u2ria.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#3183c1">Dell Inspiron 13 and 15 7000 Black Edition</font> </h2><br>  Two more consumer models continue the parade of laptops and, by the way, transformers as well.  These are 13- and 15-inch <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/2-in-1-laptops/inspiron-13-7000-2-in-1-black-edition/spd/inspiron-13-7386-2-in-1-be-laptop">Inspiron 7000 series</a> with a beautiful addition of the Black Edition in the title.  They differ only in size, and in that the 15-inch laptop has MX150 discrete graphics, otherwise the ‚Äústuffing‚Äù is identical: Intel Core i7-8565U, 16 GB of RAM, 512 GB on a fast NVMe drive and an excellent IPS matrix with touch support input, active pen and resolution of 3840x2160 pixels. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rl/gy/ot/rlgyoti6hl4ailwvqhjtfqgawg0.jpeg"><br><br>  Interestingly, the pen itself is included in the package, and the design of the notebook solves the problem of carrying it.  No more pockets and backpacks: the stylus can simply be put in a recess on the panel hinges between the working area and the display and safely close the screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vq/jr/jd/vqjrjdvngqtvzsux2jidgahcquc.jpeg"><br><br>  Cases of computers are made of metal.  The frames around the displays are not as record-breaking as those of the XPS, but also quite modest.  As weight: 13-inch model weighs 1.41 kg, and 15-inch - 1.97 kg.  There are one full-sized USB on the ‚Äútrinashki‚Äù case (there are already two ‚Äútags‚Äù), one USB Type-C, HDMI and, of course, a headphone input. <br><br>  Release of both models is planned closer to the middle of the year, so, so far, information on their availability in Russia, alas, cannot be given.  Next, go to the game releases. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ac/1d/n9/ac1dn9etjpjv_rlsc5viwpmbpdm.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#3183c1">Alienware Area 51m</font> </h2><br>  It seems that the gaming laptop can no longer surprise anything, but at CES 2019 our new <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/new-alienware-area-51m-gaming-laptop/spd/alienware-17-area51m-laptop">Alienware Area 51m</a> did succeed.  To begin, we suggest just to look at this beauty: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vx/pe/yq/vxpeyq0e1xj07bhqjfyhsva_n8i.jpeg"><br><br>  And now that inside.  Thanks to a very serious stuff, this particular laptop has become the most powerful new laptop of the whole exhibition and at the moment it can definitely be considered one of the most powerful in the world.  In the ‚Äútop-end‚Äù configuration, Area 51m includes an Intel Core i9-9900K processor (yes, you didn‚Äôt think this is the desktop version!), 32 GB of RAM and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 graphics. Plus two drives: 512 GB on two SSDs and 1 TB on a hybrid HDD.  Those.  for memory inside just three compartments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qj/th/qb/qjthqbrfi6--xn2vgwq0v0bmtkq.jpeg"><br><br>  But this is the tip of the iceberg.  Now imagine that the whole thing is placed on the board with the Z370 chipset and any of the listed components can be replaced!  And this is reality, not fiction.  Even the video card is no exception, although it was not possible to manage without a special proprietary format.  Undoubtedly, only very wealthy guys can afford such a toy, but the very fact of its appearance cannot but interest fans of games and computer hardware in general.  On occasion, we will definitely try to get Area 51m for a review on Habr√©. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_0/kk/cq/_0kkcqg3i6vqxl6nljgjgo2yod0.jpeg"><br><br>  The diagonal of the display is 17.3 inches, the resolution is Full HD, while there are various screen options with support for G-Sync, Tobii and 144 Hz.  Connector is full for every taste.  Well, the weight, of course, solid: 3.8 kilograms. <br><br>  Of course, such an unusual technique can not just be brought and massively put in all the popular stores in Russia.  Therefore, we cannot give information about the terms and prices in our country - we are at the stage of studying the potential demand.  But the cost of Area 51m in the USA is no secret.  The youngest modification is priced at $ 2,550, and the oldest is $ 4,250.  In the configurator on the American website, GTX 10-series video cards are now displayed, but at the time of delivery everything will be type-top: RTX 2060, 2070 and 2080 will be installed inside the computers. You just need to wait for their official release in February. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wx/c-/gx/wxc-gxp4rwfyqsnvd9mrj0ecll8.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#3183c1">Alienware m15 and m17</font> </h2><br>  Next, go to the gaming laptops Alienware m15 and m17.  The first was the easiest 15-inch Alienware.  This serious machine with Intel Core i7-8750H and GTX 1060/1070 weighs only 2.16 kilograms inside.  Well, Alienware m17 is one of the lightest 17-inch gaming laptops in the world.  It weighs 2.63 kilograms, and the maximum configuration can include the Intel Core i9-8950HK and GTX 1080. NVIDIA GeForce RTX new mobile graphics chips are also on the way. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u6/0f/zk/u60fzkn_jzfcindgjvuccjs-w50.jpeg"><br><br>  The design here is quite familiar to anyone who is already familiar with Alienware laptops: a metal cover, a company logo in the form of an alien head, a lot of ports both on the sides and on the rear panel.  Plus two colors: black and silver and black and red. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yk/lk/jk/yklkjkbxoxjsl9t0rhq0ygrgzqe.jpeg"><br><br>  <a href="https://www.dell.com/ru/p/alienware-m15-laptop/pd">Alienware m15</a> with GeForce 10-series graphic adapters has already gone on sale in Russia.  The price of the issue begins with 135,000 rubles.  Alienware m17 is expected on the shelves of domestic stores in March at a price of 140,000 rubles.  Also in March, the versions of both laptops with the letters SE in the title will get to Russia, which will indicate that the inside is new mobile GeForce RTX chips. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3183c1">Dell G5 15 / G7 17</font> </h2><br>  We also do not forget about those who are not ready to spend more than a hundred thousand rubles on a gaming laptop.  For such gamers, we have Dell G-series gaming laptops, the update of which just happened at CES 2019 as well. As it was before, the brand new G5 15 (5590) and G7 17 (7790) got interesting cases with a neat and rather universal design.  From a distance, "look, I'm a gamer!" These machines do not scream at all, which is very appreciated by many users. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jd/ad/e9/jdade9qpc7-f4zieizn5cswujxe.jpeg"><br><br>  In addition, now, as in Alienware machines, ports for connecting various devices in G-series machines are located both on the sides and on the back end.  And a lot of them.  There is also a card reader for SD, and three full-sized USB 3.1, miniDisplayPort, Ethernet, and, of course, Thunerbolt 3 with a Type-C interface. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7l/hs/pm/7lhspmrmj-sntilpnzjcjicyqni.jpeg"><br><br>  In the arsenal of machines, both the already familiar GTX 1050Ti / 1060 and the brand new RTX 2060/2070/2080, and the processors are already familiar from previous models of the same series - i5-8300H and i7-8750H.  It is also interesting that in the "top" versions, laptops are equipped with displays with a refresh rate of 144 Hz and support NVIDIA G-Sync technology.  And the proprietary utility Alienware Command Center has migrated to the Dell gaming laptops.  Using it, you can both optimize system performance and control the four-zone keyboard backlight.  It is, by the way, also full-sized - with a digital block. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mc/wl/re/mcwlreaztshvalj5bgxd8gbwh2g.jpeg"><br><br>  We are waiting for the updated <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/new-dell-g5-15-gaming-laptop/spd/g-series-15-5590-laptop">G5 15</a> in Russia in March at a price of 77,000 rubles.  Last year, many waited for the <a href="https://www.dell.com/community/Inspiron/G7-17-7790-G7-NEW/m-p/7190904">G7 17</a> , and now we can finally please the users who wanted it.  The older model of the G-series also gets to our market.  Only we will inform about prices and configurations a bit later - now everything is at the stage of internal discussion. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3183c1">Alienware 55</font> </h2><br>  Finally, a couple of words about one of the main gadget teasers at CES - the 55-inch gaming monitor of the Alienware 55. At the exhibition we showed its working prototype.  The main feature here is that it is built on the basis of an OLED panel with a resolution of 3840x2160 pixels with all the ensuing advantages.  In particular, the widest viewing angles, perfect black color and 98 percent coverage of the DCI-P3 color space.  In addition, there will be support for HDR, and the refresh rate is 120 Hz.  These are amazing things in the future.  The product is still being finalized, more details about it will appear in the second half of 2019. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BcuNnbHKueg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/436860/">https://habr.com/ru/post/436860/</a></p>
