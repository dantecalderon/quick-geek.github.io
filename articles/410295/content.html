So, recently the <i>third</i> generation of projectors has appeared on sale, and Epson has something to brag about. </p><br><p>  The updated line still has three models: the most "budget" Epson EH-TW5400, "standard" Epson EH-TW5600 and "advanced» Epson EH-TW5650.  The previous generation, <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/epson/blog/289029/">which was described in detail earlier</a> , also included three models with similar designations, which were modifications of the famous Epson EH-TW5200.  In this regard, it may seem that the newest update is just “planned”, without surprises. </p><br><p>  However, this time it was definitely not without surprises <i>(which is why, in fact, this post came out a week later than planned)</i> , and <b>Epson EH-TW5650 was the culprit</b> . </p><br><p>  In the title of this post is a spoiler hinting at the main and main feature of the new model, which turned out to be an <i>unexpected surprise even for ourselves</i> . </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  From junior to senior </h2><br><p>  Traditionally, let's not rush and approach the hero of this publication gradually, first highlighting the younger models of the new line. </p><br><h2>  Epson EH-TW5400 </h2><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/us/4f/mq/us4fmqmzspvro_marz1ayeov2_4.png"></div><br><br><p>  <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/projectors/epson-eh-tw5400/">Epson EH-TW5400</a> - the most "budget" model series EH-TW5xxx.  The projector supports 3D and, similarly to previous models, does it “to the conscience”, providing high brightness in 3D mode.  The Epson EH-TW5400 has a lower maximum brightness (2500 lumens, a 200-watt lamp) and better contrast than lower-cost entry-level projectors. </p><br><p>  Due to the lower brightness, the EH-TW5xxx series is not completely analogous to the new Epson EH-TW6xx models: even if they are close, the Epson EH-TW5400 will still give <i>better results in a darkened room</i> .  Although to say that it is losing in brightness, it would be unfair: the whole series has a high brightness, it is quite possible to work with large screens or in a lighted room (well, in fact, 2500 lm for this model and 3000 lm for the same Epson EH -TW610 - the difference in the region is only 15%). </p><br><p>  A diagonal of 100 inches EH-TW5400 gives from a distance of 272 cm. There is no Wi-Fi support. </p><br><h2>  Epson EH-TW5600 </h2><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4q/ip/mv/4qipmvhmeqwqpk7o0g7tujnrmwg.png"></div><br><br><p>  <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/projectors/epson-eh-tw5600/">Epson EH-TW5600</a> - "standard" version.  The projector has a more advanced lens with optical zoom of 1.6 × and the lens shift function vertically, <b>for the first time in the line of budget Epson projectors</b> , by the way! </p><br><p>  A screen with a diagonal of 100 inches is obtained from a distance from 295 to 478 cm. </p><br><p>  The difference in contrast with Epson EH-TW5400 is stated as minimal, i.e.  if you do not need lens shift and you can place the projector directly in front of the screen, or you don’t worry about some loss of sharpness when programmatically correcting the trapezoid, then you can save money and safely take the younger model ... </p><br><p>  ... or still not stop and read further, because ... </p><br><h2>  Come on!  Come on!  Epson EH-TW5650 </h2><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rx/ja/bz/rxjabzvw6iati68opt00yve3kum.jpeg"></div><br><p>  And now, we finally turn to the “highlight of the program,” the <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/projectors/epson-eh-tw5650/">Epson EH-TW5650 projector</a> , the “top-end model of the budget segment.”  What's in it "top" and why so much "HYIP"? </p><br><p>  First of all, we immediately get built-in support for Wi-Fi and Miracast - you can duplicate the screen of compatible mobile devices and even output side by side with HDMI.  So-so addition, except for "connoisseurs" who love less wires. </p><br><p>  The most interesting thing is this: for the Epson EH-TW5650 model <b>, the contrast is twice as great as that of the Epson EH-TW5400 and Epson EH-TW5600</b> !  Since the contrast value published in the specifications refers to the so-called “dynamic contrast”, which cannot be evaluated on a single frame, the knowledgeable public can out of habit simply skip this figure, referring to the fact that, they say: <i>“they invent the contrast values ​​again, comparing full on and full off with auto iris "</i> . </p><br><p>  Fairly, I do not argue.  Therefore, hereinafter we will first of all talk about the so-called.  <b>“Native” contrast</b> , i.e.  one that can actually produce <a href="http://epson.ru/technology/projection/963614/">three LCD arrays</a> installed in the projector <i>without any tricks to amplify black</i> in dark scenes, such as a dynamic aperture (which is also available on the Epson EH-TW5650). </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xr/69/yb/xr69ybdtegljhthiri62pemwavg.png"></div><br><p>  Despite the fact that Epson EH-TW5650 was <i>not</i> separately positioned by the company as something unique, it stands out from the total number of our budget models by the output image.  Therefore, in order not to be unfounded, and in order to make sure that it was not only this unique copy that we came across, I decided to see if the experts agree with this conclusion in their reviews. </p><br><h2>  Expert Opinion © </h2><br><p>  At the time of this writing, I was able to find two fairly detailed reviews of this model: from <a href="http://www.projection-homecinema.fr/2017/10/09/test-epson-eh-tw5650/">projection- homecinema.fr</a> and <a href="http://projectorworld.ru/blog/875.html">projectorworld.ru</a> (for brevity, I will call them PHFR and PW). </p><br><p>  PHFR experts, on whose account since 2013 there are more than a hundred reviews of home projectors of various price segments, gave the Epson EH-TW5650 their “Gold” award and a very high total score of 95%. </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zr/ge/nt/zrgent3mj6tpqqzdcl5jsg9xo6a.jpeg"></div><br><p>  This is what this assessment is made of: </p><br><ul><li>  Total image quality: 95% </li><li>  <b>Contrast and brightness: 97%</b> </li><li>  Clarity and smoothness: 90% </li><li>  Colorimetry (color accuracy): 100% </li><li>  Menu, Options and Accessories: 95% </li><li>  Installation: 90% </li></ul><br><p>  It is very difficult to get such a high mark <b>for the contrast</b> from them, but the numbers speak for themselves - according to the French version, the “native” contrast is <b>1700: 1</b> (in the most accurate color rendering mode).  In order to correctly compare with analogs, you can see their reviews of home models on DLP technology within 2000 Euros - the contrast, according to PHFR, will vary between 900: 1 and 1900: 1. </p><br><p>  Just for comparison: the typical contrast of an IPS monitor is around 1000: 1. </p><br><p>  That is what I wanted to tell you on such a large scale.  The fact is that the Epson EH-TW5650 contrast ratio is indeed <b>twice as high as the</b> low-end models.  In general, <i>it is not at all the "budget" level</i> , if we speak frankly. </p><br><p>  PHFRs also measured dynamic contrast (with the auto iris turned on, in the brightest mode), and they managed to get a figure very close to the stated maximum contrast ratio - <b>64132: 1</b> . </p><br><p>  The conclusion of the review authors is good news - they warn manufacturers of DLP projectors that the new Epson EH-TW5650 is already playing directly in their field, in the segment of 1080p-projectors up to 1000 Euro. </p><br><p>  Translation of a review fragment: </p><blockquote>  <i>“... he does it gracefully, offering an excellent model, equipped with all the functions necessary for a home theater, with an image devoid of significant drawbacks.</i>  <i>The image quality was so convincing that we believe that this model is also a competitor to its older brother, Epson EH-TW6700. [...] Its good contrast and properly tuned gamma allow you to enjoy the beautiful view of night scenes, while maintaining the level black deep. "</i> </blockquote><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1t/bg/q4/1tbgq4yfusmshln2nq6jyiejc4o.png"></div><br><p>  ProjectorWorld.ru comes to almost the same conclusions: </p><blockquote>  <i>“Epson EH-TW5650 is not quite what it claims to be.</i>  <i>How do you like my version, that in fact it is a “disguised” EH-TW6700 in a package from younger models and with a lower price?</i>  <i>[...] The EH-TW5650 is close in “natural contrast” to more expensive models (EH-TW6700, EH-TW7300), while leaving the EH-TW5300 series far behind.</i>  <i>[...] We can safely say that the Epson EH-TW5650 has even exceeded the most optimistic expectations in terms of contrast! ”</i> </blockquote><p>  In the list of advantages of this model in the review from PW, the first item is: <i>“A good level of contrast (for this segment) in the absence of a“ rainbow effect ”</i> . </p><br><p>  <b>Yes, by the way</b> , I would like to separately mention traditionally that the 3LCD technology, on the basis of which all our projectors operate, not only does not have a rainbow effect, but also has another extremely important feature - the <i>equality of the maximum brightness in white color and color brightness</i> .  About it in detail told <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/epson/blog/222115/">on Habré</a> and in a series of posts <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/epson/blog/286420/">"Myths about projectors" on Geektimes</a> . </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2e3/497/a13/2e3497a131a63442ae1f93bbba7238b6.jpg"></div><br><p>  The author also states that: </p><blockquote>  <i>“The competition from the manufacturers of low-cost DLP projectors has done its job, and Epson simply had no choice but to finally release the projector, which is really not inferior to most of them in contrast.</i>  <i>I have only one question: why did this have to wait so long? .. "</i> </blockquote><p>  Alas, I cannot answer the question, therefore I will simply share the joy of the author of the review. </p><br><p>  According to the PW data, the contrast level in the economy mode of the lamp is <b>1164: 1</b> (in the most accurate mode of operation), and <b>1650: 1</b> in the maximum brightness mode.  In general, projectorworld.ru and other projector manufacturers also generally get smaller numbers than projection- homecinema.fr.  Perhaps the difference is in testing methods or equipment. </p><br><p>  Immediately anticipate the question that may appear to the reader: "Why does the contrast turn out <i>higher</i> in the maximum brightness mode?" </p><br><p>  Higher contrast in the maximum brightness mode is ensured due <i>to the</i> higher dynamic range of the resulting image, i.e.  the difference between completely dark and bright scenes. </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pq/ju/nb/pqjunbn04wdootwbdi-078txhwa.png"></div><br><p>  Additional margin of brightness is responsible for the expansion of DD.  For example, if in a completely dark room specially prepared for DK, a film is shown with dark and bright scenes, then it turns out that dark scenes will be just <i>dark</i> (as they should be), and <i>light ones</i> , for example, on a bright sunny day , can be perceived as if the sun really blinded the eyes, especially with the rapid transition from one scene to another.  Whether watching movies in this mode or still switching to economical is a matter of taste. </p><br><p>  The author also reports that the automatic aperture of the Epson EH-TW5650 began to work silently, complementing the already good “native” contrast, which makes the gain in terms of contrast even more noticeable.  This and we can confirm after a long test of the projector in the office. </p><br><p>  The reviews are highly appreciated and color accuracy of the projector.  Summing up the image quality, PHFR guys write: </p><blockquote>  <i>“This small projector, it turns out, is able to reproduce a flawless image with natural colors.</i>  <i>It gives the feeling of a big cinema in your home - and that’s what we need. ”</i> </blockquote><p>  ProjectorWorld also notes that Epson EH-TW5650 is versatile, allowing the user to get a high-quality image in different lighting conditions by choosing different combinations of color rendering and lamp modes.  By the way, the projector has two modes intended for darkness (“Neutral”, “Cinema”) and two modes for illuminated rooms (“Dynamic”, “Bright Cinema”).  PW states that the choice between these modes is often a matter of taste.  All of them can be used when playing video (yes, even the brightest).  For example, the projector can work when the illumination is in quiet mode, or, if you are using the maximum lamp power mode, you can use the most accurate color rendering modes. </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/h7/g3/oh/h7g3ohuvzcg0lvxlsl1ne5okeic.jpeg"></div><br><p>  In a darkened room, it is recommended to use the lamp in eco-mode, extending its life up to 7500 hours, while obtaining a brightness of more than 1300 lumens.  The author writes: <i>"... on my screen with a diagonal of more than 120 inches, I did not complain about black and at the same time could admire the high brightness, giving excellent sensations from bright scenes."</i> At the same time, the silence of the projector is noted. </p><br><p>  PHFR agrees: </p><blockquote>  <i>“Listen! .. Nothing? .. This is normal - the TW5650, among other things, knows how to preserve silence, which its competitors in this price segment cannot do!</i>  <i>Therefore, when Santa comes to you, you just need to whisper the model number in his ear</i> . <i>”</i> </blockquote><p>  It should be noted that <a href="http://projectorworld.ru/blog/875.html">in the PW review the</a> individual modes of color rendition with their nuances, as well as the possibility of accurate calibration, are quite detailed. </p><br><p>  Let me give you another encouraging quote from PHCFR: </p><blockquote>  <i>“Although we have tested hundreds of video projectors, we are still amazed at the progress in image quality taking place in budget models.</i>  <i>The picture quality of this EH-TW5650 matches or exceeds what we could see 10 years ago with devices with a 5-fold higher price. ”</i> </blockquote><p>  And I’ll stop at this in order to “not praise too much”. </p><br><h2>  Total </h2><br><p>  Summing up, I would like to note with pleasure that the latest updates of Epson home projectors' lines were every time connected with a significant expansion of their capabilities, and not just “changing the number in the model number”.  As well as mentioning the sharp increase in contrast, which previously touched the most expensive devices - Epson EH-TW9300 and the new Epson EH-LS10000 and Epson EH-LS10500.  And now, now the changes have come to the budget segment! </p><br><p>  <i>High “native” contrast for reasonable money</i> is exactly the “Holy Grail” that most potential buyers of home theater projectors “hunt” for. </p><br><p>  And we <i>(and I do not exaggerate) are</i> sitting and thinking how to position the projectors of the 6000th and older lines now, because such a qualitative jump in the contrast level in the “budgetary” line of projectors, judging by what we saw when testing the device in the office As well as interviewing many different people, <i>it turns out to be sufficient for the overwhelming majority</i> .  Especially for the money that the company asks for Epson EH-TW5650. </p><br><p>  Links to the mentioned reviews: <a href="http://projectorworld.ru/blog/875.html">Projectorworld.ru</a> , <a href="http://www.projection-homecinema.fr/2017/10/09/test-epson-eh-tw5650/">Projection- homecinema.fr</a> (in French). </p><br>  PS And since February 19th we have a joint action with ivi.ru - when you buy a home projector, <a href="http://epson.ivi.ru/">you can get 6 months of an ivi + subscription</a> . </div>
