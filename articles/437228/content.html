<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I'll start with the good.  There is one major advantage in Bitcoin - the speed of payments. <br><br>  Yes, it is speed.  Someone may object: “how is it that I pay with the card instantly, and then I have to wait 20-30-40 minutes for the transaction to enter the unit and confirm it”. <br><br>  But everything is not quite so.  When you pay with a card, the store agrees to give you the goods "on credit".  In Russia, we will receive a refund for your goods only on the next working day, and even then the banks themselves lend to such a store, since money flows in international payment systems only on the third working day.  In Europe, it may be even longer - for example, reimbursement once a week. <br><br>  Agree, 30 minutes and a few days is already a significant difference. <br><br>  Same swift payments go a few days.  Imagine that you can ship the goods only after you pay the supplier - i.e.  you have to cover the cash gap from your pocket.  And so all modern payment systems work. <br><br>  As the barter economy evolves toward ever more complex monetary systems, transaction costs and total circulation costs decrease.  The less time we spend on the transfer of money - the lower the transaction costs.  And just then Bitcoin wins compared to conventional transfers between accounts. <br><br>  But, nevertheless, Bitcoin is not a means of payment, and here's why: its main problem is the finite issue embedded in it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  With the growth of the economy - should grow the money supply. <br><br>  For example, let's replace the ruble in the country's economy with Bitcoin and this is what we get: Suppose that in circulation 1 Bitcoin and for it you can buy 1 loaf of bread.  Production is growing and now the baker can offer 2 loaves of bread, but only 1 Bitcoin is in circulation.  Those.  for 1in bitcoin you can already buy 2 loaves of bread.  So what will a Bitcoin owner do?  He will wait tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, when he can buy 3-4-5, etc., for his 1-bit bitcoin.  loaves of bread.  He will not spend. <br><br>  Such a process in the economy is called deflation - and it is destructive.  Consumption is falling, factories are closing, unemployment is growing - the economy is entering a recession and falling into a crisis. <br><br>  This is where the state comes to the rescue - it prints more money.  In general, central banks are trying to maintain an acceptable level of inflation, stimulating the population to spend.  Sad as it may sound, the economy needs inflation. <br><br>  In Bitcoin, however, the emission is finite, moreover, the costs of issuing new coins are quite high. <br><br>  No matter how many slogans I hear, that bitcoin can be divided almost infinitely and it will be enough - this will not solve the problem of deflation. <br><br>  The slogans that we will no longer need banks are also erroneous.  In order for the economy to grow it is necessary to invest savings. <br><br>  Banks do this much better for us, while diversifying their portfolios.  Those.  banks distribute risks.  For example, they give out credit to a million people, and not to one.  Which significantly reduces the risk of losing all funds at once, if this one <br>  the person will not return the loan. <br><br>  If everyone starts to keep the currency in their own wallet - investment in the economy will decrease, which will also lead to a recession and another crisis. <br><br>  If we consider Bitcoin as a kind of currency for international settlements, then the finite Bitcoin issue here also plays a decisive role.  The world economy is growing, so for its maintenance from year to year requires more money supply. <br><br>  To summarize: Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies will remain the means of speculation and nothing more, until a better breakthrough occurs.  After all, there are positive features - this is the same speed of operations. </div>
