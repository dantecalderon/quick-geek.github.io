Given the popularity of Pear and the amount of time elapsed since the infection, it can be assumed that the malicious code has got to a very large number of service users. <br><br>  For all who have used go pear.phar for the last half year, it is recommended to check the checksums of the packets with those on github.  If the checksums are different - this means that the package is infected.  Some of the Trojans detected are: Backdoor.PHP.AZI, Backdoor.PHP.Webshell, HEUR: Trojan.Script.Generic.
