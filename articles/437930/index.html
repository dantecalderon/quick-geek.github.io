  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Lamp Design Combo</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The developers of the new modular <a href="https://swgshop.ru/catalog/combo1/">Combo</a> luminaires have tried to eliminate all the shortcomings inherent in conventional LED lamps and luminaires: <br><br>  - thanks to a massive radiator, the LEDs do not overheat and do not fail; <br>  - due to the use of LEDs with a high color rendering index CRI (Ra)&gt; 90, it is possible to achieve a quality of illumination that is not inferior to halogen lamps; <br>  - separation of the LED module and driver increases the reliability of the lamp and allows using both a normal and dimmable driver with the same LED module; <br>  - replaceable reflectors allow you to get different angles of illumination; <br>  - the body and frame of two colors of different shapes allow you to create different lamps for different conditions of use based on the same LED modules. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6a3/324/546/6a332454669d851a8aff7547866d4502.jpg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Two types of LED modules are available: with a color temperature of 3000K (warm light) and 4000K (neutral light). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/956/2c4/0ad/9562c40adcc59979765287e621d59911.jpg"></div><br>  The module is sold for 2746 rubles, complete with a non-dimmable driver and a reflector of 38 ° or 60 °.  Additionally, reflectors with angles of 15 °, 25 °, 38 ° and 60 ° are sold. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1b6/8dd/80d/1b68dd80d0345510fea6323f849f5ef0.jpg"></div><br>  A dimmable driver costs 1627 rubles and is controlled by a regular dimmer. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bd7/71d/b9f/bd771db9fd6a41457f90d7741f9c5de9.jpg"></div><br>  Luminaire housings are available in black and white, round and square, with the possibility of rotation (and, accordingly, the direction of the light beam) and without it.  Stand from 712 to 1017 rubles. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f90/5cf/d32/f905cfd325b59262e7ed66f843273db6.jpg"></div><br>  A bayonet connection is used to connect the case and the LED module, which ensures easy installation and reliable fixation of the module. <br><br>  The luminaire in the housing can be directly installed on a false ceiling or false wall (the height of the luminaire assembly is less than 80 mm and it can be embedded in a standard gypsum ceiling), in addition, luminaires can be mounted on frames that come in two colors and of different shapes for one, two or three lamps. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7c2/423/1ca/7c24231ca6c101bbaed04b75f0a3828a.jpg"></div><br>  The manufacturer claims the power of the modules is 12 W, the luminous flux is 890 lm for the module with warm light and 1080 lm for the module with neutral light, CRI&gt; 90, the service life is 20000 hours.  Modules have a two-year warranty. <br><br>  I tested the LED modules with different diffusers and different drivers.  Before testing, the modules were heated for 30 minutes. <br><br>  The actual power and luminous flux turned out to be even higher than those stated: the module with warm light consumes 13.4 W and gives 928 lm, the module with neutral light consumes 13.8 W and gives 1151 lm. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0e8/a25/2ee/0e8a252ee6cbacc97c1696adef479bc6.png"></div><br>  The color rendering index of the modules is really high, and the CRI (Ra) value of the “warm” module is 96.8.  It is very good. <br><br>  The standard non-dimmable driver uses a linear voltage conversion circuit, so the minimum supply voltage at which the luminance of the luminaire is reduced by no more than 5% is 200 volts, and the coefficient of light pulsation is 1.9%. <br><br>  Dimmable driver is built on a pulse converter.  Luminaire with this driver can work without dimming when the mains voltage drops to 121 volts.  Light ripple factor - 10%.  Power factor (PF) - 0.96.  A ten percent ripple can be seen through the camera of a smartphone, but it is completely unnoticeable visually and does not exceed the level of the pulsation of an ordinary incandescent lamp. <br><br>  Measured light angles with different reflectors. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b78/68b/c28/b7868bc2818a7391d40d4abc6071b057.png"></div><br>  In the near future, a new LED module with a dimmable driver and a variable lighting temperature during dimming will be on sale. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a6/d79/d41/3a6d79d416da2f0441e95a5ad52add7a.jpg"></div><br>  Pay attention to the horizontal strip in the center of the phosphor circle.  This module uses two types of phosphor and separate control of two groups of LEDs.  With a small brightness when dimming, only those LEDs that are located under the phosphor, giving a yellow light with a color temperature of 2000K, are on.  As the brightness increases, the LEDs gradually light up under the entire remaining area of ​​the phosphor, which gives 3000K, and the light begins to turn white.  At full brightness, the color temperature of this module is about 2900K.  A more advanced phosphor with the same high overall color rendering index gives a more uniform transfer index of individual colors.  For comparison, on the left, there is a standard Combo module with a warm light, on the right, a new module. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0a7/6ad/108/0a76ad108c8415d8653b7ca82c642d6b.png"></div><br>  A fee for a uniform color rendition - less efficiency.  The new module consumes more (14.8 W), and gives less light - 864 lm.  But the level of pulsation is reduced to 0.5% and the lamp can work without dimming when the voltage drops to 155 volts. <br><br>  Combo luminaires are manufactured under the Lumker brand (this is one of the SWG premium brands). <br><br>  Based on one of the four variants of the LED module, two variants of the driver, four variants of the reflector, eight variants of the housing and sixteen variants of the framework, you can assemble several hundred different fixtures suitable for different applications. <br>  SWG does not offer such an interesting solution for the first time - I have already talked about the Villy luminaire designer ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/lamptest/blog/410675/">habr.com/ru/company/lamptest/blog/410675</a> ) (by the way, now all Villy luminaires with a CRI&gt; 90). <br><br>  In addition to the variety of shapes and colors, Combo lamps provide high-quality light, similar in properties to the light of traditional halogen incandescent bulbs.  The manufacturer gives a warranty of 3 years, but most likely these lamps will work much longer.  In fact, these are professional fixtures for home use. <br><br>  PS Video review: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oWpB7B4-bvc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DoWpB7B4-bvc">www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWpB7B4-bvc</a> <br><br>  © 2019, Alexey Nadyozhin </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/437930/">https://habr.com/ru/post/437930/</a></p>
