  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Yellow - Vacuum - Cloud</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> For the last few years, for some strange reason, I have been trying to push people to expand their professional horizons.  I am convinced that in the modern world it is impossible to occupy a worthy place, being engaged in a highly specialized activity - only a highly specialized activity (with rare exceptions). <br><br>  There are, for example, guys who are called ‚Äúcoders‚Äù - they don't want to know anything about the subject area, they care only about the quality of the code, about the performance, about the correct data structure. <br><br>  It is, of course, not bad, but these guys are constantly <i>dependent</i> on the environment.  They need a translator - a methodologist, who translates the customer's task into terms that are understandable to the coder. <br><br>  Accordingly, the coder has a restriction on the places of work - a clean IT company or an enterprise with a large and diverse IT department is suitable. <br><br>  The wagon has a little more features - it can understand the language of users, almost all dialects.  But the wagon, as a rule, does not know how to speak <i>the language of business</i> (this language is different from the dialects of users).  There is already an <a href="https://habr.com/post/437298/">article</a> on a similar topic, I will not repeat. <br><br>  But today - not about that, today - about technology. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Recently, I climbed out of a cozy yellow house and found that there are many problems of a certain class in the world that I personally do not know how to solve at all.  Tasks sound like this: <i>create high-availability business applications</i> .  Simply put, web based business applications. <br><br>  Of course, I used to hear about such applications, because I worked as a CIO.  The company needed a website, the company wanted both cloud-based CRM, and a system for managing tasks and projects accessible from anywhere, and an online store.  Unfortunately or fortunately, I have always been able to move away from solving such problems on my own with the help of a well-known technique ‚Äî to find contractors or a turnkey solution using the SaaS model.  As a result, the company spent a <i>lot of</i> money without getting a decent result.  But more about that later.  The only exception to this list is the task and project management system, which I did on 1C in a thin client, but there is nothing to be proud of. <br><br>  While still sitting in a cozy yellow house, I, along with my guys, looked around at Bitrix and its integration with 1C.  We found one niche convenient for ourselves: it turned out that the database on MySQL is hidden inside Bitrix, and you can work with it through the external data source 1C mechanism.  You can write and read and create tables. <br><br>  The thought arose in my head that good, useful and effective solutions can be built with this simplest technology.  For example, we remade our ‚Äúslider‚Äù for a corporate portal in Bitrix, on which a real slider was already standing (which is swiped with a finger on the phone), and in its slides you can see charts on indicators from 1C using Google Charts.  It looked funny, was implemented elementary, and looked very nice on the phones of managers - it scaled to fullscreen, understood the screen rotation, scrolled, did not require data exchange and mobile application installation, the correct authorization is in the Beatrix box. <br><br>  I even talked with familiar web vendors (bitriksoidami and ordinary) about how demanded customers integrate Bitrix and 1C, I wanted to tackle this topic tightly with them.  No one bothers, for example, instead of tables with indicators, to drive data tables into Bitrix ‚Äî the same documents or reference books to implement, for example, personal accounts of suppliers.  Integration is simple, understandable for 1Snik, you can respond to system events, set arbitrary filters, use layout schemes, etc. <br><br>  But something somehow did not go, web vendors showed no interest in my ingenious technology, but oh well. <br><br>  I was greatly embarrassed by the lack of knowledge and development experience within Bitrix, i.e.  on php.  Simple forms to draw with grief in half and with the help of friends-webmasters came out, but there was a great lack of confidence in their abilities.  To myself began to remind that coder which is dependent on colleagues. <br><br>  It was still possible to close my eyes to this gap in my knowledge for a long time, but I like others learn to be honest with myself, to recognize the presence of a collective farm in myself in order to get a starting impetus in development.  I decided to use my own recommendations myself, admitted my worthlessness in developing web applications for business (not to consider the 1C database published through IIS) and went to Padawans to the Jedi of this topic. <br><br>  I look at web applications through a prism of the experience with 1–°, and with corresponding stereotypes.  Therefore, if you are a seasoned web maker, please be lenient with my ignorance and gross errors.  I'm still at the beginning. <br><br>  <i>The first</i> thing that catches your eye when developing web applications is <i>countless tools and technologies</i> .  These are programming languages, frameworks, data transfer formats, execution and debugging environments, notations and development rules, available for using DBMS, etc.  I will not enumerate and analyze, you yourself know all this. <br><br>  <i>The second</i> is striking not immediately, but after several months of communication with customers, existing and potential, but it plunges me, as 1Snika, into shock: why such a huge mass of technologies, such an incredible number of specialists, create such a <i>humiliatingly small range of business solutions</i> ?  This, in the first place, is not about ready-made solutions, but about platforms and technologies for their creation (I‚Äôm the same old hardened :)). <br><br>  With web applications for ordinary people, it‚Äôs understandable - there‚Äôs everything, or almost everything, that a man in the street needs.  Social networks there, find a person on a photo, speak in voice or letters, play tanchiki, watch vidos, etc. <br><br>  <i>And for business what?</i> <br><br>  The most common business application is simply <i>the company's website</i> .  I, with a stretch, manage to call the site a <i>business application</i> , but the fact remains.  Theoretically, sites are created to solve business problems.  For example, to attract customers, there is a very wide range of services on this topic.  The only thing that confuses is the prices of manufacturing sites, even on popular platforms.  Those sites that I saw from inside the companies did not bring much sense to the business, but the prices were equal to the projects for the implementation of accounting systems. <br><br>  The second most common web application for business is an <i>online store</i> .  Implementation options are also quite a lot, and ready, and to order.  The cost also varies greatly, as is the business benefit.  No, there are of course businesses built around an online store that have nothing but it - the same dropship.  But mostly the online store is such a trendy app for the site.  Moreover, it usually goes in the platform box, why not deploy it (for the customer‚Äôs money). <br><br>  There are still all sorts of <i>communicators</i> - plug-ins and platforms for organizing feedback.  For example, on sites such a window, which persistently asks to enter a phone number, so that someone then called back.  And I, damn it, an introvert. <br><br>  A larger topic is <i>task management systems and projects in the cloud</i> .  There are a lot of such systems, they are usually distributed according to the SaaS model, respectively - they are not customized, they are poorly integrated (in the sense of fussing more than good).  As an accounting system for the tasks are suitable, but they do not bring great benefits either. <br><br>  What else?  And, yes, <i>services</i> .  1C, for example, has many services, such as direct bank, search for counterparties by TIN, electronic document management, counterparty checks on databases, etc. ... Also delivered as SaaS, but the part built into the customer‚Äôs accounting system can be customized.  Useful, of course, things in life, but a revolution in business will not. <br><br>  Web applications such as <i>mail</i> , <i>cloud storage</i> or server rental and rendering facilities will not be mentioned.  They are either highly specialized, or already so taken for granted that they are on a par with Word and Excel. <br><br>  There are, of course, <i>ready-made solutions</i> - all large Western ERPs have a web-face in about the same years.  Jedi say that it is built on the outdated technology at the moment, but I am not ready to discuss it yet.  I repeat, I am confused by the lack of customization of ready-made solutions from large vendors.  These are ready-made solutions like Basic Accounting.  It is impossible to build with their help a small solution for small or medium business for reasonable money.  And the cost of licenses horse. <br><br>  And small and medium businesses continue to attack.  They want personal accounts of suppliers, personal accounts of dealers, distributed systems for several hundred or thousands of people for the public sector, non-visual services for receiving orders, flexible customizable task management systems, systems for collecting data from equipment with real-time analytics, fast consolidation of several databases without purchases of the Great and Powerful Configuration for a million rubles, or how much it costs there. <br><br>  They want to work with dealers, customers, suppliers in a <i>single database</i> through the web.  They do not want to maintain any other system, drive data back and forth, and work in different interfaces (an exception is made for BP, ZUP and KA kids, as without them). <br><br>  They (almost all, oddly enough) want the opportunity to work <i>offline</i> , or when the connection is broken (this, alas, is still a disaster on our collective farms), and they do not want to keep the base on the client and perform exchanges, then processing the collisions.  They want it as an e-mail that lives quietly on the phone in the absence of the Internet - you can watch all the letters, you can write new ones (without sending, of course) - and when a connection appears, it all syncs with the cloud itself.  So they want to see their applications. <br><br>  Almost everything that customers want in terms of <i>business logic</i> is easily implemented on the 1C platform.  It has almost everything you need to solve accounting and analytical problems. <br>  For example, directories in which you can easily decompose interrelated regulatory-related information.  Or documents that correctly (well, or at least habitually) reflect the events of the economic life of the enterprise.  Registers of accumulation in which the residuals and turnovers in the necessary analytics correctly lie.  Reports, which, together with SKD, provide an incredible scope for customization of the work of analysts. <br><br>  But <i>for 1C, the right web-based business applications do not</i> , for two main reasons: <i>dull yellow muzzle</i> and <i>poor performance with a large number of connections</i> (including all aspects of performance - the amount of resources consumed, blocking, cost, and in general, the need for licenses, and so on. d.). <br><br>  If you abstract and imagine that 1C has the right face and there are no problems with thousands of simultaneous users (this is such a thought experiment), then you <i>get the ideal platform for creating high-availability business applications</i> . <br><br>  Judge for yourself.  Imagine as part of a mental experiment, how much time do you need to create an online store in UT 10.3 configuration?  If you do not think about the interface and performance, then the cost of such a task will be <i>from zero to several hours</i> .  Just do the correct RLS (the user sees all documents related only to it), we launch the user into the system, and ... that's it!  I went in, made a purchaser's order for myself, chose items (pictures, prices and balances in the form of choice), held the document, and enjoy life. <br><br>  Of course, it will be necessary to twist something for self-service.  For example, payment.  Or autoreserve with delivery dates.  But, you see, for 1Snika such tasks are spit and grind.  Moreover, they are all solved. <br><br>  You can also add the separation of data, then in general there will be a high. <br><br>  Exactly the same amount of time, or even less, is needed to organize personal accounts of suppliers. <br><br>  To organize a project and task management system, you don‚Äôt need to do anything at all - you just run people into your 1C: Workflow 2 and set up profiles correctly.  Although probably not ... Pomer 1C: Document circulation 2. RIP. <br><br>  If you talk like that, then <i>almost any of the tasks I know for ‚Äúbusiness applications on the web‚Äù can be solved using the 1C platform</i> . <br><br>  Now we remove rose-colored glasses and remember that this was a thought experiment.  We will not launch anyone anywhere, because a healthy person will not want to work in a <i>yellow</i> online store.  A healthy business will not want to keep a hell of a physical cluster of servers that will withstand the influx of users through web clients into an unhappy database.  Not to mention how much money you have to pay for licenses. <br><br>  Some guys get out, separating 1C and the web into different applications, and organizing communication through http-services.  This is a very exciting activity, but the essence is lost - again we have two loosely coupled applications, and in the web part we will have to <i>once again</i> describe the business logic, store data, draw forms and work out events. <br><br>  Moreover, with high probability we can say that in the web part of the system, either you get a <i>boring</i> job or you have to do a hell of a job. <br><br>  Why <i>hell</i> ?  Now it is clear: because there is no 1C platform with its data structure.  There are no reference books and documents, no accumulation registers, no reports.  There is a bare database, empty forms, no objects, primitive events, omnipotent javascript and, as mentioned at the beginning, countless low-level technologies available (for creating objects and high-level components).  For example, react.js. <br><br>  Speaking more simply, to create a web application for business, like on 1C, you <i>will first try to write a 1C web platform</i> .  At least a piece - a reference book there, a small document, otchetik, diagrams.  The behavior of these classes is at least minimally invented and programmed. <br><br>  Actually, web makers often do this.  Therefore, such horse prices for creating adult business applications on the web.  <i>That's why there are so few adult business applications on the web</i> - nobody wants to pay horse money. <br><br>  There are, of course, people who buy such work.  There are many such projects in the state and municipal sectors, in the housing and utilities sector (such as personal accounts of consumers of electricity, water, etc.), electronic diaries for schools.  You can judge the quality of such applications yourself; you probably use them once a month.  Of course, these are not business applications, and they are often not made for ‚Äútheir‚Äù money, but I think it was worth mentioning them. <br><br>  <i>The final dilemma</i> : <br><br><ul><li>  The web has resolved issues of beautiful snouts and high availability of applications and data, but there is no platform for a quick description of business logic. </li><li>  In 1C resolved issues quick description of business logic, but ugly, beyond the developer yellow face, and the low availability of applications and data. </li></ul><br>  How will we decide? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/438174/">https://habr.com/ru/post/438174/</a></p>
