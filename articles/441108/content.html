Sometimes companies <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/221575/">presented concepts</a> that were either non-working at all or worked, but partially. <br><br>  Now it seems that the very near future has already come.  Samsung Corporation introduced a fully working folding phone, which entered the consumer market.  It is called Galaxy Fold, and its value ... let's say, is slightly higher than the average market price - $ 1980. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Now it is not on sale yet, you can buy it starting from April 26th.  Initially, it will be distributed through AT &amp; T and T-Mobile networks in the United States.  Then, on March 3, Samsung Fold will make happy by its appearance in the stores of European users.  And the price of the phone will be even higher - 2,000 euros. <br><br>  In principle, there were no such phones before, which is why Samsung allowed herself to manufacture such an expensive device.  The central element of the phone is a 7.3-inch display, called the Infinity Flex Display.  If desired, the phone can be turned into a small tablet or folded, putting it in your pocket. <br><br>  When folded, the display dimensions are 4.6 inches.  The main screen is QXGA +.  The internal memory in the phone is 512 GB, which is quite good.  This is fast Flash Universal Storage 3.0 (eUFS) memory.  Eight-core Qualcomm processor, made on 7 nm process technology.  RAM - 12 GB.  As for the battery, there are two of them at once - one for each half of the folding phone.  The total battery capacity is 4380 mAh. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fcf/d3f/b68/fcfd3fb68247bde2fc3fc4398f4231c0.gif"><br><br>  According to the developers, they have equipped the device with reliable “loops”, so there will be no problems with opening and closing the gadget. <br><br>  The camera is also worthy - it is a triple system, which can be used both in phone mode and in tablet mode.  The corporation will release devices of different colors, but, of course, they will not buy the device because of the jolly colors. <br><br>  The operating system is Android, Samsung has modified the OS so that it can keep three applications active at once.  It was done for a reason - working with such a system, at first glance, is quite convenient. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7ab/bcc/069/7abbcc06947ff4a77a2b80c0d2104fb1.webp"><br><br>  Most popular applications are optimized for a folding screen, the corporation is now working closely with Google in terms of optimizing Android 9 Pie for a new type of screen. <br><br>  Previously, the corporation has already demonstrated the work of various applications, with the transition from telephone mode to tablet mode and vice versa.  The transition is quite smooth.  How convenient it will be to work with a new type of device is not yet clear - too many questions arise.  Over time, they will receive all the answers - soon we can expect an influx of Galaxy Fold reviews. <br><br>  By the way, Samsung Corporation is not the only one who develops folding smartphones.  But only she launched the sale of the gadget around the world, and this is not a piece of trade, but a massive one. <br><br>  In January, another company, Royole, <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/435512/">began</a> selling a folding display phone.  The gadget was shown at CES, it got the name FlexPai.  The phone (or tablet) received a flexible screen with a diagonal of 7.8 inches in the unfolded state. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/983/ddc/cc0/983ddccc0ff4fab4c5fdf5566b5fb689.jpg"><br><br>  With the hardware on the phone, too, everything is not bad, like that of Samsung.  Inside the gadget is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 processor with eight Kryo 485 cores operating at a frequency of 1.80 GHz to 2.84 GHz, a graphics accelerator Adreno 640 and a Snapdragon X24 LTE 4G modem.  RAM - 6 or 8 GB, SSD - 128 or 256 GB.  There is also a slot for microSD memory cards.  Cameras with 16 and 20 million pixels, a GPS module, an accelerometer, a gyroscope, a barometer, light sensors and proximity sensors, a USB Type-C port are installed.  The battery received a capacity of 3800 mAh.  The dimensions of the device are 134.0 × 190.3 × 7.6 mm, weight - 320 grams. <br><br>  Xiaomi, LG and other companies have previously shown their own folding phone concepts. </div>
