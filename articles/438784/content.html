<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In recent days, we observe a very strange behavior of the Yandex.Metrica service.  Some sites in which you need to enter / select user data, began to behave is not very adequate.  When you completely clear the browser history, the problem disappears, but then everything resumes. <br><br>  The essence of the error, as can be seen from the screenshots, is in the JS-error of the script located at <a href="">mc.yandex.ru/metrika/tag.js</a> .  Now (11:41 04.02.2019 Moscow time) this error can be seen, for example, on the Aeroflot website, having tried to choose the direction of flight from the siteâ€™s muzzle: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_v/k-/ld/_vk-ldwuzsz3ghlzc03bwridyoq.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Admins of our service (also very popular and loaded) reported a drop in traffic, the error was the same: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/i3/s4/so/i3s4so0gy3liuqjrwwdh-z8q6mm.jpeg"><br><br>  Thus, we can conclude that the problem is quite common (at the moment). <br><br>  It would be interesting to know the company's position on this issue.  Metric is a universal tool, this script is being implemented on many third-party pages.  It seems that we have very convincing evidence of how a third-party script de facto breaks the business process on the websites of the companies where it is used. </div>
