<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  <strong>Facebook</strong> opened its office in Boston in 2013. At first it was a team of several engineers and in five years the number of employees exceeded two hundred, the current office became small and a new spacious room was found next door, where Facebook occupied 3 floors (130 thousand sq. Ft.) or 12 thousand square meters) and where it can accommodate more than 650 people.  A rough hiring plan is 50-100 people a year, so the new office will be filled gradually. </p><br><p>  Geographically, the office is located in <del>  Boston </del>  Cambridge, it is across the river from Boston.  The campus of the famous MIT is located nearby, Harvard University is located a bit further in Cambridge.  They work on different projects: machine learning, Oculus VR, infrastructure (CDN, proxy and multimedia server cache), network technologies (WiFi networks with distribution from drones / satellites), as well as products such as Safety Check, blood donation and recommendations. </p><br><p>  I was invited to Facebook on Boston - Open House, which took place on the 9th of January, 2019.  During the tour of the office, it was allowed to photograph everything except the marker drawing boards. </p><br><p>  Note: under the cut a large number of photos. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3 id="openspeys">  Open space </h3><br><p>  All engineers are sitting in the openspace.  The ceiling seems unfinished, but it was conceived - as much as possible to repeat the design of the head office. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vb/kr/wk/vbkrwkibksyaulywsxmonqdpuqs.jpeg"></p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/f3/9h/nv/f39hnv72loxybjzub759md15kie.jpeg"></p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cm/pa/q5/cmpaq5aewtuokkenwzxavcay4qg.jpeg"></p><br><p>  Separate the space sofas, where you can sit with a laptop. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ix/7h/sz/ix7hsziomlqlaplauzdtreqf5rs.jpeg"></p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/my/th/tz/mythtzcqsvss1fdzjjw9e12f3ak.jpeg"></p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fc/br/h3/fcbrh3ptekxhzl2ltx1pflmdmgo.jpeg"></p><br><p>  Corridors in places resemble some kind of production facility. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/me/-c/xn/me-cxnfbltv5dvvmdzx55c8l_vu.jpeg"></p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-m/5m/oe/-m5moed3oqmomc5eczzhb91qvqo.jpeg"></p><br><p>  Some walls are works of art. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8y/pz/fv/8ypzfvtxfp8aka5nv6ftyoj8kli.jpeg"></p><br><p>  Printer, copier, office - everything is normal. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5x/pj/t9/5xpjt94i9jk7v6c6uman651p4ds.jpeg"></p><br><p>  Many meeting rooms. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fz/jf/v4/fzjfv4kkuuqiou8djvwxvpomdsg.jpeg"></p><br><p>  Conference hall. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nr/cx/g5/nrcxg5fx5p2-tupvqj8m401vvr4.jpeg"></p><br><h3 id="kuhni">  Kitchens </h3><br><p>  Kitchens are located on each floor. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/iu/l8/jt/iul8jtgjan9cxgo4sdzfe0ylzeg.jpeg"></p><br><p>  Coffee, drinks, snacks, all for free. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uf/7y/y1/uf7yy1qbizbsjgxraxg5k_zb6b0.jpeg"></p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/o7/oy/bk/o7oybkixwnccorrt9un1m4xnxgy.jpeg"></p><br><h3 id="stolovaya">  Canteen </h3><br><p>  The food is free, the choice is large <em>(unfortunately the time was no longer working, the food was not included in the frame)</em> </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yt/ce/qj/ytceqjhp7jrimpznhgmuxoamqyc.jpeg"></p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fm/5c/tl/fm5ctlrh2joxw27qnv10l3amcly.jpeg"></p><br><h3 id="mesta-otdyha">  Resting places </h3><br><p>  You can play Oculus VR, there is a ping-pong table </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tf/1c/00/tf1c00gamc0lwule2bftikjsos4.jpeg"></p><br><p>  Music room </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ua/ey/lh/uaeylhxfdbzmpmnu-pzxzsyvmxo.jpeg"></p><br><p>  Libraries, board games </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/df/mv/j1/dfmvj1vkwwxrspxw2yo4medvko4.jpeg"></p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fh/hq/ny/fhhqny12oc6ob730r9kqri0pwty.jpeg"></p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6v/mw/-6/6vmw-67lxxdwl7-s5iulxao0bpo.jpeg"></p><br><p>  Thank you for looking through to the end. </p></div>
