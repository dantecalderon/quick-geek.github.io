<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In Russia, life in the first month of each year is wont to freeze in the alcoholic salad “groundhog day”.  Our winter tradition is not spread all over the globe, and crowdfunding projects did not take a break at all.  Already in January, many of them crossed the finish line and are preparing for production.  Here are a dozen of the most successful of them - at least financially. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ey/wz/l-/eywzl-c3bjuecje1noylokebevg.jpeg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  # 1 Vinci 2.0 Wireless Headphones </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-9/xr/js/-9xrjslkbhsi0vxqwii0vuns2g0.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Raised <i>:</i> $ 885,522 with a target of $ 20,000 <br>  <i>Deliveries:</i> scheduled for March 2018 for Kickstarter backers.  Accepting orders in the near future will continue on Indiegogo <br><br>  The Vinci name is well known for following the latest crowdfunding.  Yes, these are the smartest “artificial intelligence” headphones that successfully collected almost a million dollars in 2016.  The startup Inspero, which created them, decided not to stop there, and in November 2017, launched on Kickstarter, a campaign of neckband wireless headphones - Vinci 2.0. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sOptOc1UdNY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Like the older version, the new gadget is a completely autonomous device, a cross between a smartphone, a fitness tracker and headphones (you still need a smartphone to set it up).  The device supports 3G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, is equipped with a gyroscope, accelerometer, microphone and a pair of OLED touch-sensitive displays, and on the inside of the rim there was a place for an optical heart rate sensor.  Since the headphones weigh only 86 grams, it is doubtful that the sensor will not “jump” during training.  Vinci speaks in the voice of Alex's virtual assistant and supports more than 12,000 teams.  The battery should be enough for 8 hours of active use (and 168 hours in standby mode). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/un/5x/xl/un5xxlvdnws0bobn6lipn0sziii.gif" alt="image"></div><br>  Interestingly, there are three versions of headphones.  The cheapest, Lite, in retail will cost $ 149 and has only 8 GB of internal memory.  The Pro Memory model has 16 GB, there is an active noise cancellation system at a price of $ 289.  Last, Super, with 32 GB of memory and has noise reduction, and a microphone with bone conduction.  All this is for $ 399.  The most important thing: regardless of the “stuffing”, Vinci 2.0 headphones fit well on the head and do not tend to fly into the ditch.  Your turn, Apple. <br><br><h3>  # 2 Security system for smart home Akita </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yy/ck/v5/yyckv5vl1yvwwe4omblnc3rv9vq.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Raised:</i> $ 884,254 with a target of $ 30,000 <br>  <i>Deliveries:</i> scheduled for April 2018 for Kickstarter backers.  <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/akita-instant-privacy-for-smart-homes-security">Campaign continues on Indiegogo</a> <br><br>  In October 2016, the idea of ​​a smart home was dealt a serious blow.  This made the botnet of smart video cameras, baby monitors and routers infected with the Mirai virus, which attacked the Dyn DNS service.  The attack "laid" a lot of major services and sites, thereby clearly demonstrating the vulnerability of today's version of IoT.  Akita gadget was designed to solve this problem (but not in the root; alas, this thing does not change all logins and passwords from admin / admin to PROh4xOr / s7R0n9pA22W0Rd). <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vYRK4Lwj_ik" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Externally, Akita looks like a strange Bluetooth column or an abstract sculpture that makes it a Norton Core smart router.  Unlike the latter, the new device is a physical firewall monitor without routing functions.  Akita connects to the router that is already at home or in the office via a LAN port, and then ensures that all connected smart devices communicate only with allowed addresses. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ou/kv/t7/oukvt7zt-iubw4imqbdkefya76u.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Again, unlike the Norton gadget, we are not talking about the DPI traffic bit-by-bit analysis method, but only about IPS (intrusion prevention system).  When any unauthorized device tries to connect to the network, or if your smart light bulbs suddenly decide to participate in a DDoS attack, Akita blocks such independent activity.  A warning is sent to the smartphone, after which the application will offer to contact customer support.  It is expected that in retail the device will cost $ 139, and the monthly consultation fee will be $ 15-25. <br><br><h3>  # 3 OneManBand MIDI Controller </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wi/i_/hq/wii_hqbhlsssp9f9tae796v9f58.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Raised:</i> $ 704,946 with a target of $ 50,000 <br>  <i>Deliveries:</i> scheduled for September 2018 for Kickstarter backers.  <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/onemanband-a-new-way-to-play-guitar-music">Campaign continues on Indiegogo</a> <br><br>  Gadgets, processors and other gadgets for the guitar does not happen much.  At first glance, OneManBand is another candidate for a good music collection.  However, he has more ambitions than gathering dust on a shelf next to a rare pedal.  A small device turns a single guitarist into an entire group, automatically generating accompaniment to his playing. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vUUXNJzbekc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  In fact, the OneManBand is a very advanced MIDI controller.  It exists in two versions: as already built into an acoustic or electric guitar, or as a separate module that can be attached to your instrument.  The module is glued behind the bridge, and in addition to the frets along the neck of the guitar, a long wire is soldered.  If the steel or stainless steel frets - the focus will not work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vy/xj/ur/vyxjur_kzkll-fejey5c1gd5hnc.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  The gadget recognizes touch to each fret thanks to "capacitive and inductive technology."  That is, in the MIDI controller mode, it is not necessary to pull the strings, it is enough to touch the fingerboard with your fingers.  Accompaniment will also be generated, but in this case it is still better to play with both hands.  The gadget is wired and comes complete with its own pedal and smart application.  The retail cost of a separate module starts from $ 249, guitars with a module start at $ 449 for acoustics and from $ 799 for an electric one. <br><br><h3>  # 4 Unilid Universal Cover </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ic/bc/iy/icbciykbtqmq1vvjttgqsfenmjc.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Raised:</i> $ 597,535 with a target of $ 5,000 <br>  <i>Deliveries:</i> scheduled for May 2018 for Kickstarter backers.  <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/unilid-one-lid-fits-all-lifetime-warranty-home">Campaign continues on Indiegogo</a> <br><br>  Plastic food storage containers have one weak point: the lids.  Covers are confused, do not fit in other containers, are lost and then turn into garbage in a landfill.  It seems to be a trivial and stupid problem, but the Two Pillars startup from San Francisco took it seriously.  Developed in the company, Unilid covers fit all kitchen containers, tightly grip the edges and prevent air from getting inside. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rxAT9Ql56No" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  C Unilid into an airtight container easily turns any can, including an open canning - or even half a watermelon.  As for plastic containers or utensils, the shape does not matter, the lids equally well tighten on both round and square containers.  Size is important, so the kit includes 5 covers, from very small to large.  The material of the covers is eco-friendly (sic!) Silicone.  On top of each lid there is a round "timer" that sets the day of the week when the contents of the container have been packed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/d1/7c/iu/d17ciu5hndldufx3qzl2w4rdaje.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Lids can be washed under a tap or in the dishwasher, kept in the refrigerator, used in a microwave and put in a hot oven (up to 230).  The retail price of the Unilid set is $ 25. <br><br><h3>  # 5 ERL Wireless Headphones </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fs/t6/4z/fst64za8ymrqjqal4kvkg-boxy0.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Collected:</i> $ 298,059 on January 10, the campaign continues and the fees exceeded $ 550,000 (indemand campaign) <br>  <i>Deliveries:</i> started at the end of January. <br><br>  Graphene headphones are increasingly appearing on crowdfunding platforms, and the list of promised benefits is about the same.  The ERL Wireless wireless headset fully complies with it: there is a graphene-coated diaphragm — there is an “unsurpassed” work time — there is a comfortable fit — there is a stable connection — there is a microphone and virtual assistants support — too. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/au3_mIut9G8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  However, the operating time is not particularly impressive: 3.5 hours on one charge and 40 hours with a charging case.  When the wired headphones are completely extinct, every extra hour will be perceived as manna from heaven.  But so far the consumer has something to compare with, and the comparison is not in favor of wireless “gags” (not to mention the fact that the batteries of popular AirPods last for 5 hours). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/28/hc/q-/28hcq-kxuajwzmkun9l6pilvm7g.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  The presence of a graphene diaphragm sounds promising.  Of course, the first buyers and reviewers did not try out the new gadget and it’s hard to say how it really sounds.  In the same ORA headphones, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/413314819/ora-the-worlds-first-graphene-headphones">funded by Kickstarter</a> , the diaphragms are completely graphene.  How do the ERL headphones compare with them?  You can find out right now by paying $ 49 on Indiegogo - or wait and buy headphones for $ 79 already. <br><br><h3>  # 6 Personal air conditioning blö </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zo/lz/c3/zolzc3csse9v7nqbasm5cqlsvji.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Raised:</i> $ <i>466,206</i> with a target of $ 5,000 <br>  <i>Supplies:</i> Kickstarter backers start in February, <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/blo-first-micro-cooling-device-w-essential-oils">fees continue on Indiegogo</a> <br><br>  Wearable air conditioning blö development start-up blo technologies fully deserves the prize of audience sympathy in our January top.  A small gadget is a portable fan that blows the heated body of the person who put it on with a pleasant menthol breeze.  Yes, exactly: a diffuser is built in the gadget that works with liners with essential oil.  The air flow passes through the oil and focuses on a specific point in the body.  The specific location depends on where it is attached: at the collar of a T-shirt, at the pants, or anywhere else.  According to the creators of the gadget, it provides cooling at 3.3 ℃ or 6.  The fan speed is adjustable and varies between the three modes of operation. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/g8/2j/bx/g82jbxolabrqpszi4j9kk8hh-24.gif" alt="image"></div><br>  Interestingly, blo technologies decided to move somewhat away from the model with cartridges, which many other start-ups got hooked on.  Although this is not emphasized, the liners are reusable and can be reused with any essential oil.  Traces of old oil are hard to scrub, so it is better to have separate liners for each flavor.  The battery lasts for 4-8 hours of operation, depending on the speed of the blower, and then the gadget can be easily recharged via microUSB (that is, an ordinary trust bank will work).  The retail cost of the device is $ 79.  Coolness on a hot day is priceless. <br><br><h3>  # 7 Wireless charging Funxim </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wa/tf/xr/watfxrytcx6hn8eujwkc9tfzbrq.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Raised:</i> $ 448,097 with a target of $ 10,000 <br>  <i>Deliveries:</i> started in January for Kickstarter backers, <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/funxim-affordable-fast-wireless-charging-pad--2">campaign continues on Indiegogo</a> <br><br>  While Apple pulls up and does not release the promised wireless charging of AirPower, competitors are trying to quickly occupy a new niche.  For example, the Chinese company Funxim: it managed to launch a couple of versions of wireless chargers on <a href="https://z.jd.com/project/details/89852.html">the JD.com crowdfunding platform</a> ( <a href="https://www.jd.com/pinpai/262065.html">and a few went straight to the JD store</a> ), and now came to Kickstarter with a charging mat. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9f/gm/ui/9fgmuijhd6nkwnkwrqrvyfralgo.gif" alt="image"></div><br>  The gadget called Funxim Wireless Charging Pad allows you to simultaneously charge your smartphone and Apple Watch smart watch.  The rug is advertised as an accessory specifically for Apple devices, but it is also suitable for Android-based smartphones, since it works according to the Qi standard.  Charging power is 10 W, energy efficiency - 80%.  In order to charge the phone on the rug, it is not necessary to remove the case from it: to charge the clock, you will need to insert the complete “tablet” from them into a separate slot on the rug (the wire fits into the groove provided for it).  The retail cost of the device - from $ 79. <br><br><h3>  # 8 Orbitkey Key Ring </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9i/0o/ai/9i0oai2y764cycuz9qzn-n2dhx8.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Raised:</i> $ <i>354,512</i> with a target of $ 35,000 <br>  <i>Deliveries:</i> scheduled for March 2018 for Kickstarter backers, <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/orbitkey-ring-clip-strap-keyring-reinvented-fashion">campaign continues on Indiegogo</a> <br><br>  Some companies turn to crowdfunding to finance VR glasses, smart designers, or other “serious” projects.  Others are innovating so barely noticeable that the final product fits easily into a pocket.  For example, the Orbitkey startup in January successfully closed the crowdfunding campaign, the subject of which was a smart key ring. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KYeqhgPayE4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The meaning of the accessory is that it opens and closes comfortably.  Inside the outer ring of stainless steel is another plastic.  It is enough to clamp the holder on the plastic ring and turn it so that the gaps coincide - and you can put on or remove the keys.  Orbitkey development is more convenient than traditional key rings, as it is not required to sacrifice a nail to open it. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/de/xi/dj/dexidjacw-t-zi01atu21u1wkrw.gif" alt="image"></div><br>  In addition to the ring itself, the Australians offer a comfortable carbine and leather strap to it.  The retail cost of the ring is about $ 15, a kit with a carbine will cost $ 48, and with a strap - $ 38. <br><br><h3>  # 9 Tiny Puna multitool and Crane folding scalpel </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8q/va/rr/8qvarr6lk650ehzhgv7bxuciaek.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Raised:</i> $ 305,620 with a target of $ 112,700 <br>  <i>Deliveries:</i> scheduled for June 2018 for Kickstarter backers.  <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/3-coil-world-s-smallest-folding-knife-multi-tool">Order taking continues on Indiegogo</a> <br><br>  London studio 3COIL Design has conducted a successful campaign on Kickstarter for two similar gadgets: the Puna multitool and the Crane folding knife.  Both tools are made of stainless steel and have scalpels as the main blade (the package includes removable ones).  Another common point is the miniature size.  When open, the Crane is 94 millimeters long, and 52 millimeters when closed;  The total length of the Puna is 101 millimeters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/um/wt/ky/umwtkyje44miasljivgcsfmf_uo.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  The similarities end there.  Puna is a witty device in the form of an automatic rifle.  It even comes unassembled in its own "case" in the best traditions of the militants.  Each stylized detail is a separate tool: a silencer - a tiny screwdriver, a barrel - a scalpel, an emphasis and a butt - an opener for bottles, two clips - a screwdriver.  Thought out details like the palm rest, so using the gadget should be comfortable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3g/xc/3d/3gxc3dvbkfozlpniqfbmamyo1tq.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Crane is a simpler thing, in fact a very sharp folding scalpel.  Designers say that both knives can not accidentally open up in your pocket.  The Puna price for backers starts at $ 28, and the Crane price starts at $ 18.5. <br><br><h3>  # 10 Projection Display for Hudly Wireless Car </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yw/sa/yd/ywsaydpxnwt0geap-9u1q8trlyu.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Raised:</i> $ 279,351 with a target of $ 50,000 <br>  <i>Deliveries:</i> will begin in March 2018. <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/hudly-wireless-the-next-gen-head-up-display-cars-technology">Campaign continues on Indiegogo</a> <br><br>  Startup Hudly is back at Kickstarter with the second version of its projection display for the car - Hudly Wireless.  The original device consisted of two separate parts, the projector and the screen;  The second version combines the one and the other in one case, so that it is more convenient to install it in the car. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Tn-FbMcnak" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The diagonal of the new Hudly display is 6.2 inches, the resolution is 800x480 pixels, the brightness is 2500 cd / m2, and the viewing angle is 30 °.  The gadget is powered by a cigarette lighter, connected to a mobile device via Wi-Fi.  The display shows all popular applications, and the smartphone serves as a control panel for it.  Built-in speakers are provided for sound reproduction. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ry/it/ec/ryitecdn7kevu_lvq5pg6nbb1cy.gif" alt="image"></div><br>  Since since the advent of the first Hudly, the idea of ​​an “interface” for a car has been picked up by many other startups, for the second version, the developers from Silicon Valley had to invent their own “zest”.  It lies in the fact that the display is not concave, and flat, and provides better visibility than the competition.  Plus, it is clearly visible in any light.  The retail price of the novelty is $ 349. <br><br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26amp%3Butm_medium%3Dpr%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3Dnakraudfandili1"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d29/4c3/07d/d294c307dde04335ac3f425e73b36a7a.gif"></a> <br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/about/mails/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26amp%3Butm_medium%3Dpr%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3Dnakraudfandili1"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7fa/417/fe3/7fa417fe3d464fa5aa186b1ab30da53a.gif"></a> </div>
