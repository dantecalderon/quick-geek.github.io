<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Regarding all potential news in the near future, I would like to very briefly say the following about AvtoAndroid: <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  1. Readers, please - perceive this information in the key " <i>... one of the many operating systems on board the car has finally become the AutoAndroid version ...</i> ". <br><br>  2. At the same time, this is only the OS version for the machine-human interface.  No more. <br><br>  3. None of the safety-important functions of this Android will not be controlled. <br><br>  4. All the most geek-interesting things in the car are tied to very different nodes and completely different OS, because: <br><br>  5. Android - it is not a real-time OS.  And for real security, nodes with real-time OS are responsible - most likely with implementations of OSEK / AUTOSAR standards. <br><br>  The bottom line is, if we draw an analogy with smartphones 7-8 years old, the news would look like: " <i>Finally, for the first time in the world, smartphones will be able to take full advantage of MS Office - now in mobile!</i> " <br><br>  Until then, see you soon! <br><br>  Best regards &amp; MfG </div>
