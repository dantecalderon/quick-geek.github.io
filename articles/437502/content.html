<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I am on Habré for a little over a year, I write quite a lot, someone reads all this crap, puts pluses and subscribes to me.  Thanks to all. <br><br>  For your advantages, they give me such things as invites, the opportunity to add articles myself, and recently I also received an icon, and now my vote is worth 2 units. <br><br>  So here.  You do me good, I return it.  Invites and pros. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  With invites, this is the case.  I came up with such a term - habrodazhdacha.  Yesterday I was surprised to find that the Internet does not know such a word.  Google honestly admits that he has never heard of it, Yandex gives out advertising for Husbro. <br><br>  Habrasdacha - this is an action that I conducted in the FB, when I had an invitation.  He wrote something like "Another habrodaradacha.  The first one to leave a comment will receive an invite. ”  Usually, the invite left after 10 minutes. <br><br>  In general, in the form of sending an invitation there is a hint that a person should be good.  I thought, and decided - if a person is in my friends at FB, then he is a good one.  Even if he does not think so. <br><br>  But here is bad luck.  I distributed 20 invites.  Of these, at the time of this writing, 3 are not activated. <br><br>  What does it mean?  The person is good, but he doesn't need an invite.  And Habr is not needed.  In reserve took an invite.  It turns out, I throw out good in the trash. <br><br>  Someone may well need this kind of good, but the ways to get it, for one reason or another, are in no way amenable. <br><br>  With those who activated the invite, all is not smooth either.  12 people have not written a single comment, not to mention the articles.  Accordingly, only read (if at all go).  Read, as I recall, without invites.  Again, good thrown in the trash. <br><br>  There you can also throw 3 more people who wrote one comment each. <br><br>  In general, everything is bad.  Good are those who do not consider it good.  And I waste my time in vain - I write these habrodale, then find out the e-mail, sometimes even remind you to activate the invitation.  And then I worry that the good disappears. <br><br>  From now on, I, as a law-abiding habro-citizen <s>crab</s> , will only give invitations to authors in the sandbox.  I myself am the author of writings, and with respect I treat any author of any writings.  Especially - to those who write for the first time.  I know how difficult and scary it is. <br><br>  I will have a simple rule: invites - for authors. <br><br>  But that's not all.  There are also pluses, in my case +2.  But I honestly admit that I don’t use this good at all.  Even if I read an article, I stupidly forget to put a plus. <br><br>  Up to this point I have not been subscribed to any hub, and not one author.  I read only what accidentally catches my eye.  However, above I said that I respect any author of any writing. <br><br>  It turns out a contradiction.  I respect all the authors, but I don’t give any advantages to anyone.  You can not do it this way. <br><br>  Therefore, from today I honestly perform my obligations.  I subscribe to all authors who subscribe to me, and put the benefits to all their publications.  Indiscriminately. <br><br>  Because they are authors.  Authors should help each other.  I'm not going to compete with any of you for anything.  But I learn from many. <br><br>  Plus, posting is, after all, a way of community self-regulation?  A tool provided to participants to implement, so to speak, the regulatory function.  Optional Obligations.  But - at its own discretion.  Like a hammer, you can hammer nails, you can prop the door, you can stir borsch. <br><br>  I will have a simple rule.  My plus is an expression of approval to the author, regardless of the content of the article. <br><br>  I want the authors to create more publications, and do it more often.  This is the only way to increase writing skills - through practice.  No theoretical skills will help if you do not write. <br><br>  Now the rating of any publication is an equation with a bunch of unknowns.  And I will be a constant. <br><br>  Well, still karma remained.  Now I have a simple and proven algorithm.  When someone subscribes to me, I add karma to him.  It is very simple and convenient - I sat down once a day, pierced all the letters with the subject “such and such now is monitoring your activity ...”, he added and left.  While I am writing this text, 4 such letters arrived, and I raised three karma.  Alas, one read-only turned out to be - here I am powerless. <br><br>  With the distribution of such good as karma, in general, I do not know how to be.  Probably, I will leave such an algorithm. <br><br>  Look like that's it.  The most strange publication of all that I wrote. <br><br>  PS Lord moderators!  If I have violated something in this publication, it is only through carelessness.  I carefully re-read the sections of the rules relating to the content of this article, and did not find violations.  But if you have a different opinion, I agree with you without a dispute and will remove the publication in drafts. </div>
