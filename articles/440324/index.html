  <section class="page js-page"><h1>New Foundation from Linux Foundation - it will develop edge computing</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In our blog, we <a href="https://habr.com/en/company/it-grad/blog/430896/">already talked</a> about the two "fresh" funds of the Linux Foundation - GraphQL and Ceph.  Last month, the consortium established another project - Edge, whose task will be the development of cloud and peripheral computing.  We tell who has already become a member. <br><br> <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/it-grad/blog/440324/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yw/lj/4s/ywlj4sw-zccjtkv-oiqnod3w6rq.jpeg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>/ photo <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/noaaphotolib/5050610013/">NOAA Photo Library</a> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC BY</a></i></font> <br><br><h2>  Why do we need a new fund </h2><br>  Today, the edge computing market is highly fragmented - all open and proprietary solutions have no integration and are being developed in isolation from each other.  At the same time, the popularity of IoT gadgets, which are the basis of peripheral computing, continues to grow.  According to analysts, the number of "smart" devices <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2017-02-07-gartner-says-8-billion-connected-things-will-be-in-use-in-2017-up-31-percent-from-2016">will exceed</a> 20 billion by 2020.  The Linux Foundation believes that in order for all these gadgets to function, humankind will need a ‚Äúwhole ecosystem‚Äù.  It is precisely its creation that will be dealt with in the new fund. <br><br>  Edge projects will focus on creating open-source frameworks for developing peripheral computing that would not be tied to a proprietary hardware or operating system.  The companies in the fund will also deal with standardization of terminology in the field of edge computing. <br><br>  Linux Foundation Edge has already been <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/edge-computing/new-linux-foundation-project-aims-open-and-standardize-edge-computing">supported by</a> fifty IT giants, including Red Hat, IBM, Intel, Arm, Qualcomm, DellEMC, HPE and Baidu. <br><br><h2>  What projects are already in the composition </h2><br>  "Under the wing" of the new fund <a href="https://www.lfedge.org/projects/">are still</a> five projects - Akraino Edge Stack, EdgeX Foundry, Open Glossary, Home Edge and EVE.  Next, we briefly describe each of them. <br><br>  <a href="https://wiki.akraino.org/"><b>Akraino Edge Stack</b></a> .  Cloud platform that implements the concept of peripheral computing.  It offers users an edge infrastructure capable of processing data in real time - the maximum delay will be twenty milliseconds.  At the same time, Akraino can be used with third-party cloud platforms to create an ecosystem of edge applications and containers. <br><br>  The platform is managed by OpenStack.  For data storage, developers used Ceph storage, and distributed IT infrastructure nodes are managed by a KVM hypervisor with Open vSwitch.  Some of the tools are based on solutions discovered by AT &amp; T. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.edgexfoundry.org/"><b>EdgeX Foundry</b></a> .  An independent framework consisting of microservices for working with Internet of Things devices.  The basis of EdgeX is the open source IoT stack Fuse used in the Dell Edge Gateway.  The EdgeX project has more than 125 thousand lines of code and includes a selection of ready-made microservices for analyzing, processing and protecting data.  The platform gives developers the opportunity to "go through" the entire life cycle of an edge-application (from design to deployment) on one platform. <br><br>  A quick start guide can be found <a href="https://docs.edgexfoundry.org/Ch-QuickStart.html">in the official documentation</a> from the creators of the solution. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.lfedge.org/projects/openglossary/"><b>Open Glossary</b></a> .  An initiative that will help IT professionals "speak the same language."  There is no established terminology and a single translation of the basic concepts in the edge computing industry.  The creators of the project intend to solve this problem.  They form a dictionary in which basic terms <a href="https://www.stateoftheedge.com/glossary">are collected</a> in alphabetical order with definitions and references to related concepts and usage examples in context.  All information is available in English. <br><br>  Open Glossary documentation can be found in <a href="https://github.com/State-of-the-Edge/glossary">the project repository on GitHub</a> . <br><br>  <a href="https://www.lfedge.org/projects/homeedge/"><b>Home edge</b></a> .  A project by Samsung Electronics, which is a platform for managing peripherals in a smart home.  It will include a set of APIs that will work with different libraries and third-party production environments. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.lfedge.org/projects/eve/"><b>EVE, or Edge Virtualization Engine</b></a> .  Application Container Infrastructure with Peripheral Computing API and IoT Devices.  The source code was written in the American startup Zededa.  EVE edge containers <a href="https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/edge-computing/new-linux-foundation-project-aims-open-and-standardize-edge-computing">differ</a> from conventional Docker containers in cross platform.  Representatives Zededa compare their development with Android, which "combined" mobile devices from different manufacturers.  EVE will be distributed under the Apache open source license in March of this year. <br><br><h2>  Other Linux Foundation Funds </h2><br>  In addition to the Edge in the Linux Foundation, several other funds are developing cloud technology.  Among them are the <a href="https://www.cloudfoundry.org/">Cloud Foundry</a> and the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/">Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a> . <br><br>  The first develops a unified platform for developing, testing and scaling applications based on different cloud infrastructures, frameworks and services.  Cisco, Google, IBM, Microsoft and others are involved in its activities.  At the same time, Cloud Foundry solutions are already <a href="https://www.cloudfoundry.org/why-cloud-foundry/">used by</a> 60% of large corporations - their representatives point out that the platform helps, on average, save ten weeks and one hundred thousand dollars to create one application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bf/nl/wn/bfnlwnvpfdf0szf48hduzrrdcqk.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>/ photo <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/133530809%40N08/39159453091/">Jasmine Nears</a> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">CC BY-SA</a></i></font> <br><br>  The Cloud Native Computing Foundation is the foundation from which the Kubernetes orchestration tool, the Prometheus monitoring system, the Envoy proxy service and the CoreDNS DNS server came out.  In the ‚Äúincubator‚Äù of CNCF, fifteen more projects are being developed, tailored for different tasks: from protecting the production environment to storing files in the cloud and exchanging messages. <br><br>  The fund <a href="https://www.cncf.io/about/members/">is</a> supported <a href="https://www.cncf.io/about/members/">by the</a> majority of IT corporations, whose work is connected with the cloud: from VMware and Oracle to ZTE and SUSE.  Last year, eighteen thousand people <a href="https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/CNCF_Annual_Report_2018.pdf">participated</a> in the development of CNCF projects, and the number of participating companies increased by 130%. <br><br>  Overall, the Linux Foundation already supports thousands of organizations, and their number is growing.  According to last year's report, in 2018, on average, one company joined the consortium per day.  At the end of January 2019 <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press-release/2019/01/the-linux-foundation-welcomes-22-new-members-from-cloud-energy-security-and-semiconductor-industries-2/">,</a> another 22 new members <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press-release/2019/01/the-linux-foundation-welcomes-22-new-members-from-cloud-energy-security-and-semiconductor-industries-2/">joined the</a> fund - from the sphere of cloud technologies, semiconductor manufacturing, security and energy.  Therefore, it can be expected that soon the Linux Foundation will open more new funds, whose work will be aimed at developing the IT ecosystem. <br><br><hr><br>  A couple of materials from our corporate IaaS blog: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/tendencii/kak-iaas-pomogaet-razvivat-biznes-tri-zadachi-kotorye-reshit-oblako/">How IaaS helps grow your business: three tasks that the cloud will solve</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/kejsy/onlajn-uslugi-dlya-b2cb2b-iz-oblaka/">How to place 100% of the infrastructure in the cloud and not regret it</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/tendencii/mir-do-i-posle-kak-izmenilas-zhizn-s-nastupleniem-dns-flag-day/">The world before and after.</a>  <a href="https://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/tendencii/mir-do-i-posle-kak-izmenilas-zhizn-s-nastupleniem-dns-flag-day/">How life has changed with the advent of DNS Flag Day</a> </li></ul><br>  Recent posts from our Telegram channel: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://t.me/iaasblog/192">What you need to know about hosting PCI DSS</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://t.me/iaasblog/193">Why do you need encryption in the cloud</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://t.me/iaasblog/194">How else does the IaaS provider protect customer data</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/440324/">https://habr.com/ru/post/440324/</a></p>
