<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p> Not long ago, I was faced with a production task — to launch the trained <code>Kesas</code> neural network <code>Kesas</code> in native <code>C++</code> code.  Oddly enough, the decision was not at all trivial.  As a result, there appeared its own library, which gives such an opportunity.  How is it - neural networks on clean crosses and there will be a small article today. </p><br><p>  Those who can not wait - <a href="https://github.com/gosha20777/keras2cpp">here is the</a> repository on github, with a detailed description of the use.  Well, and all the rest I ask under the cat ... <a name="habracut"></a></p><br><h3 id="postanovka-problemy">  Formulation of the problem. </h3><br><p>  In the process, I needed to run a trained model in a <code>C++</code> application <em>(Unreal Engune 4)</em> .  But bad luck: today there is almost no way to run the Keras model in C ++. </p><br><p>  The option of calling <code>Python</code> from <code>C++</code> did not seem good to me.  Another option was to convert the Keras model to the <strong>TensorFlow</strong> model and then <em>build the TensoFflow under the crosses</em> and call the API TF from C ++ code. </p><br><p>  This process of metamorphosis is well described in <a href="http://bitbionic.com/2017/08/18/run-your-keras-models-in-c-tensorflow/">this article</a> .  But with this also difficulties arise.  <strong>First</strong> , TensorFlow is going through <code>Bzzel</code> .  And the bezel itself is capricious and refused to assemble under <em>UE4</em> .  <strong>Secondly</strong> , the <code>TF</code> itself is quite a <em>big and cumbersome</em> thing, but I wanted something lighter and more productive.  I can only say that in the github open spaces a <a href="https://github.com/pplonski/keras2cpp">semi-working project</a> was found, with the functionality I needed.  But, he did not support current versions of <code>Python</code> and <code>Keras</code> .  And the attempts to remake it were not crowned with success: The <em>C ++ application failed with the <code>Core Dump</code> error</em> .  It was decided to write their own implementation ... </p><br><h3 id="pishem-svoyu-biblioteku">  We write our library! </h3><br><p>  Turning the rock heavier, throwing a bottle <del>  pivasa </del>  energy, I sat behind the code.  In many ways, the TensorFlow code, attempts to rehabilitate the code found on <code>гит</code> , some knowledge about algorithms and data structures <em>(thanks to ITMO for its courses)</em> and good ear music helped me in implementing this library.  Anyway, the library was written overnight. </p><br><p>  <strong>And so meet: Keras2cpp!</strong> </p><br><p>  The first part of the library is the <em>Python</em> module for saving the trained model in its own <em>binary</em> format. </p><br><p>  There is nothing difficult in this operation.  We simply read the <code>Keras</code> model and write bitwise to the file: first <code>тип слоя</code> , then the <code>размерность</code> , then <code>матрицу весов</code> in the <code>float</code> format. </p><br><p>  We now turn to the most delicious - C ++ implementation. </p><br><p>  Two <code>tensor</code> and <code>model</code> entities are available to the user. </p><br><p>  <strong>Tensor</strong> - <em>transfers the data with which the neural network works and is a computer implementation of the tensor.</em>  Currently, the maximum dimension in <strong>4</strong> dimensions is supported.  <em>The dimension of</em> each dimension is stored in the <code>std::vector&lt;int&gt; dims_;</code>  and the <em>weight of</em> each tensor element is in <code>std::vector&lt;int&gt; data_;</code>  .  From the available methods you can select <code>void Print()</code> and <code>Tensor Select(int row)</code> .  The rest of the operations you can see in the source code.  After the math for tensors was written, I started to implement the models. </p><br><p>  <strong>Model</strong> - <em>is a set of layers in each of which operations on tensors and weights matrix are registered.</em>  Two functions are available for the user. <code>virtual bool LoadModel(const std::string&amp; filename);</code>  and <code>virtual bool Apply(Tensor* in, Tensor* out);</code>  . </p><br><p>  Here is a complete code example. </p><br><p>  <em>python_model.py:</em> </p><br><pre> <code class="python hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span></span> numpy <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">as</span></span> np <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span></span> keras <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span></span> Sequential <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span></span> keras.layers <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span></span> Dense <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">#create random data test_x = np.random.rand(10, 10).astype('f') test_y = np.random.rand(10).astype('f') model = Sequential([ Dense(1, input_dim=10) ]) model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer='adam') #train model by 1 iteration model.fit(test_x, test_y, epochs=1, verbose=False) #predict data = np.array([[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]]) prediction = model.predict(data) print(prediction) #save model from keras2cpp import export_model export_model(model, 'example.model')</span></span></code> </pre> <br><p>  <em>cpp_mpdel.cc:</em> </p><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs"><span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-meta">#</span><span class="hljs-meta-keyword"><span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-meta-keyword">include</span></span></span><span class="hljs-meta"> </span><span class="hljs-meta-string"><span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-meta-string">"keras_model.h"</span></span></span><span class="hljs-meta"> int main() { </span><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-comment">// Initialize model.

Enjoyable use, and I will go to my favorite C # and Python to write neural networks further. </p><br><h3 id="ps">  PS </h3><br><p>  I liked writing this library.  When you write everything yourself from scratch, you understand more, but how it works ... Plans to add support for other architectures and GPUs ... </p><br><p>  <em><a href="https://github.com/gosha20777/keras2cpp">github repository</a></em> <br>  <em><a href="https://gosha20777.github.io/neural-network/2018/11/21/keras2cpp/">A source</a></em> </p></div>
