I decided to put together in one place a list of online services that would be useful to those who seriously thought about immigration.  Surprisingly, there are not so many ‚Äúlive‚Äù and active startups in this area.  For the article, I selected four projects. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  <a href="https://smilebright.media/sb-relocate">SB Relocate</a> - professional immigration counseling in the USA </h2><br>  The user needs to leave a request, which indicates the purpose of the move, as well as issues that cause difficulties - from choosing the type of visa to everyday issues such as finding an apartment, buying a car, etc.  After that, he will be able to get the necessary information in the course of a video call or in the format of a text manual with useful links to email. <br><br>  In the case when the question is to find a professional to solve specific problems - from lawyers to accountants - the user receives the recommendations of experts with whom the service team has already worked. <br><br>  Among other things, users can order personal branding service - the project team will help to tell about professional achievements in large Russian-language and English-language media - lawyers often use such materials to prepare applications for some work visas. <br><br><h2>  " <a href="http://poravalit.com/">It</a> 's <a href="http://poravalit.com/">time to blame</a> " - information on moving from expats from different countries </h2><br>  The service that has been operating since 2017 is a platform where potential immigrants can find consultants who have already moved to their countries of interest.  To start work, you need to select the target country for the move, as well as the method of migration. <br><br>  After that, the system will issue a list of people who have already moved to the same country in the same way - work, study, purchase of real estate in order to obtain a residence permit, downshifting, marriage.  If such people are not found, the robot will automatically offer the most suitable consultants from the nearest regions for replacement. <br><br>  Consultations can be paid and free - it all depends on the desires of a particular consultant.  Communication takes place in the chat. <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://www.fileright.com/">FileRight</a> - automated preparation of documents for obtaining green cards and non-working visas in the United States </h2><br>  In addition to the popular English-speaking media startups BorderWise and Boundless, the service provides not only the preparation of documents for obtaining green cards based on marriage or family reunion. <br><br>  In addition to this standard set of services through FileRight, you can prepare documents to change the status within the United States - this is necessary, for example, to switch from a tourist visa to a working visa.  Documents are filled in with answers to questions in English (Spanish is also available), then the documents are checked for errors, the user is provided with recommendations on how to submit the finished package of documents. <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://relocate.me/">Relocate.Me</a> - service for job search with the possibility of moving </h2><br>  The platform on which vacancies of international IT companies are posted.  The essence of the service is that only vacancies are published on the site, which imply relocation and assistance in moving by the employing party.  Jobs of companies that do not help applicants with relocation are not published on the service. <br><br>  At the moment, the main focus is on technical positions in European countries, such as Germany and Holland, but there are also options in other regions - for example, in Australia.  The creators also suggest using a separate resume composing tool (CV). <br><hr><br>  What other projects (especially like the closed VisaBot) for immigrants do you know?  Leave the links in the comments, you can make an update of the article. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/440724/">https://habr.com/ru/post/440724/</a></p>
