Make it, in fact, forced.  True, the authorities did it not by their whim.  The problem is that miner equipment interfered with T-Mobile’s mobile network equipment. <br><br>  We are talking about interference in the range of <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/coverage/coverage-phones-700">700 MHz</a> .  So far, this has only happened in Brooklyn, New York.  But the precedent has been created and, probably, soon we will hear about other similar cases.  The equipment that the miner used is not improvised, this is the Antminer S5 Bitcoin Miner system.  It is in free sale, and if the interference does take place, it seems strange that the authorities did not detect this before. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The check was initially carried out very simply - the equipment turned on and traced the signal transmission in the network.  After analysis, it turned out that the problem is really in mining equipment.  According to the laws of the United States, now the company, whose activities are disclosed, has the right to file a case for retrial. <br><br><div class="oembed"><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-0" style="position: absolute; visibility: hidden; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg); width: 500px; margin: 10px auto; max-width: 100%; min-width: 220px;"></twitter-widget><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" data-twitter-extracted-i155125442991651576="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">  Okay, this <a href="https://twitter.com/FCC%3Fref_src%3Dtwsrc%255Etfw">@FCC</a> letter has it all: <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/bitcoin%3Fsrc%3Dhash%26ref_src%3Dtwsrc%255Etfw">#bitcoin</a> mining, computing power needed for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/blockchain%3Fsrc%3Dhash%26ref_src%3Dtwsrc%255Etfw">#blockchain</a> computation and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wireless%3Fsrc%3Dhash%26ref_src%3Dtwsrc%255Etfw">#wireless</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/broadband%3Fsrc%3Dhash%26ref_src%3Dtwsrc%255Etfw">#broadband</a> interference.

Inside there is nothing special that could give such a strong signal.  In order to understand this, you need to know the scheme of the device itself.  Perhaps the user has modified the original scheme, having an undesirable side effect for the operator.  So far, the regulator is exploring the possibility that the system radiates at the specified frequency.  "In the course of the investigation, we could not find out whether the system complies with the original characteristics." <br><br>  Cryptocurrency enthusiasts often customize the original scheme of a system designed to calculate blocks of cryptocurrencies, so this is not out of the ordinary.  However, the Federal Communications Commission does not know what is causing the incident. <br><br>  An investigation is still underway.  The device owner was asked to answer a number of questions regarding the device and place of purchase.  The FCC asked the person responsible for the problem to provide information about the device, including the manufacturer, model, serial number and the fact that the device passed the FCC check. <br><br>  Currently used Antminer S5 systems are priced at $ 600 on Amazon.  When Bitcoin miners went on sale, they cost $ 450.  Shipment of devices started at the end of 2014.  From that moment, Bitmain introduced several new models of its “computing centers”. <br><br>  <b>Antminer S5 features:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Hashrate: 1155 gx / s ± 5%; </li><li>  Chip model: BM1384 second generation (30 pcs.); </li><li>  Those.  chip manufacturing process: 28 nm; </li><li>  Network: Ethernet; </li><li>  Cooling system: 1 fan model 12038 + 2 radiators on the working boards of the device; </li><li>  Power Consumption: 590 W; </li><li>  Energy efficiency: 0.51 J / gh; </li><li>  Power Interface: four 6-pin PCI-E connectors (for full operation, only two are needed); </li><li>  Operating temperature: 0-35 ° C; </li><li>  Certified by: FCC / CE; </li><li>  Overall dimensions: 298mm (length) x 137mm (width) x 155mm (height). </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bfd/aaa/7db/bfdaaa7db5ef0c0a6e94d2d57665b337.jpg"><br><br>  Model Antminer S5 is clearly outdated, so it is unlikely the American used the original device.  Now the company offers all sorts of updates for the device, in addition, the user himself could make some updates, with the result that the corresponding effect was obtained.  Mashiki for mining are popular equipment, they are bought and sold around the world.  Probably, if the problem with the interference with the equipment of cellular operators would be the same common, then it would have long been known. <br><br>  The device is a standard <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2581%25D1%2585%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0_%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">ASIC</a> .  This is an integrated circuit, specialized for solving a specific problem, in our case - only for bitcoin mining.  Schemes of this kind are many times more profitable than video cards, since  with more power (speed calculation hash) they consume much less energy.  This was a good reason for creating a cryptomonet mining business.  Someone gets coins for himself, and someone leases available capacity, getting fiat currency for this, and not bitcoins, broadcast, or any other coins. </div>
