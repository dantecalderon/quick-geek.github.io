Sales <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/433592/">of Yandex.Telephone</a> began on December 6, 2018, but in less than a month retail networks managed to sell <b>only 450 devices</b> , Vedomosti reports, citing data from GfK received by retailers.  The bonuses that Yandex offers to customers did not help either: <br><br><ul><li>  six months of free food delivery, a subscription to Yandex.Taxi, Yandex.Music and films in Kinopoisk; <br></li><li>  300 rub.  on Yandex.Taxi; <br></li><li>  500 rub.  on Yandex.Money; <br></li><li>  10% cashback on purchases through Yandex.Money for three months. </li></ul><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As the company wrote in the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/yandex/blog/431998/">official blog</a> , “Yandex.Telephone” is the first smartphone on the market with voice assistant “Alice”.

According to GfK, in December a little less than 3.5 million units were sold in Russia.  Thus, from the start of sales, Yandex captured no more than 0.013% of the market. <br><br>  Independent analysts say that December is not the best time to start selling a new smartphone at full price, because at this time competitors are making substantial Christmas discounts.  According to the results of January, sales of Yandex.Telephone may grow, so that the total sales volume in Russia should reach 1000 units. </div>
