Making and implementing in the future a part of them in the all-electric version will be a huge step forward for the development of the electric vehicle market. <br><br>  Ford also announced that it <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autoshow-detroit-ford-motor/ford-plans-11-billion-investment-40-electrified-vehicles-by-2022-idUSKBN1F30YZ">plans to invest $ 11 billion</a> in the development and production of electric vehicles by 2022, which will allow the oldest automaker to add 40 hybrid and electric vehicles to its model range (16 of which are planned to be created with full-fledged electric vehicles, 24 - hybrids). <br><br>  But it was not so much the clarity and obviousness of the above statements that struck as the fact that there are already workers and tested prototypes of new electric vehicles, such as, for example, the prototype of the F-150 electric pickup. <br><br>  <u>January 16, 2019</u> - an official statement from Ford CEO James Farley at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, USA. <br><br>  <u>February 7, 2019</u> - <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/02/05/electric-ford-f-150-prototype-spy-photos/">the first photos of</a> testing the prototype of the electric pickup F-150 appeared. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8r/o3/cr/8ro3crckbl-psb6yeoexfcwfnf0.jpeg"><br><br>  Thus, Ford is working seriously on this task and there will be more information about its electric innovations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hy/iy/jd/hyiyjd6tkdp5hnvvyy7ao1vncso.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/c7/ks/zd/c7kszdcat6znbmod9enygvvstsa.jpeg"><br><br>  What can be seen in the photo: <br><br><ul><li>  it is clear that this is a test version of the prototype F-150 EV, which will ultimately differ from the production model, which, in a year and a half, I hope, will come off the assembly line; </li><li>  the way to connect to the charger through the charging port located in the lower right part of the front bumper will be very inconvenient for use, so engineers still need to work out this moment; </li><li>  The frame of the prototype F-150 EV is raised slightly higher than that of the standard version F-150, most likely because of the flat battery compartment located under the cab; </li><li>  the tip of the exhaust pipe is very intrigued, it is likely that this site was specifically left to divert attention and disguise the real functionality of the tool; </li><li>  judging by the thickness of the charging cable, the pickup is connected to a charging system using a CCS ( <a href="http://tesla.o.auroraobjects.eu/Design_Guide_Combined_Charging_System_V3_1_1.pdf">Combined Charging System</a> ) connector, which indicates that it is really an electric vehicle (EV) or a PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle) hybrid with a very large battery, which is less probably. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xi/v7/um/xiv7umzude4o2oapfal1t70m1io.jpeg"><br><br>  By the way, here is another photo taken with similar prototypes earlier (here the connector in a different place is installed and the battery part under the body is visible): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hd/_0/cq/hd_0cqmo9u0kn-_yixtsjxp_a9y.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-i/r2/y1/-ir2y1gw3gtinmcq5zjyzwn5jma.jpeg"><br><br>  By the way, these photos of the Ford F-150 Limited 2019 show that the standard version of the F-150 does not have an extra wide plane from the bottom of the cabin, like the prototype, and that in the normal version the fog lights are located at the place where the charging connector prototype, as well as the exhaust system with the output of the rear pipes, and not on the side, as the "snag" of the prototype. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pm/2r/5h/pm2r5ht_nh5rr-rwj9890a6mwuu.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vz/xi/0t/vzxi0tfavbygq5gwfdupjjn3nby.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4_/eo/lc/4_eolcly0aukeuoo2souz8zot-8.jpeg"><br><br>  In addition, Ford has previously announced that it will work closely on the design of electric vehicles with concern Volkswagen AG. <br><br>  Ford F-150 Electric Pickup Truck, expected performance (so far according to the data here): <br><br><ul><li>  expected model year for release: 2020-2021; </li><li>  planned power not less than 650 hp, </li><li>  battery at least 180 kWh, </li><li>  cruising range of at least 320 km </li><li>  towing capacity not less than 4500 kg. </li></ul><br><br>  Here is an example of using a pickup truck with a serious traction load, which is why the towing capacity in the base is rather high: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nt/xm/_r/ntxm_rgawezvtym0z_vykh_cux4.jpeg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/439326/">https://habr.com/ru/post/439326/</a></p>
