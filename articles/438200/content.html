Sometime in the near future, smartphones will come with more than one terabyte of internal memory that will work 10 times faster than an SD card. <br><br>  Samsung is best known as a manufacturer of smartphones, but a division of the company that develops memory modules - one of its most profitable divisions - just recently <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-breaks-terabyte-threshold-for-smartphone-storage-with-industrys-first-1tb-embedded-universal-flash-storage">announced</a> the start of mass production of flash memory chips for smartphones with a capacity of 1 TB.  It is not reported yet when exactly they will appear in smartphones, but Samsung said it plans to increase the production of these chips in the first half of this year. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  "Fans of offline data storage will be able to use a memory capacity comparable to laptops, without the need for additional memory cards," said Samsung. <br><br>  The declared capacity of 1 TB doubles the previous maximum, produced by a Korean company used in the Galaxy Note 9 (512 GB model), which overcomes the milestone in terabytes when adding an SD card with a similar capacity of 512 GB. <br><br>  Samsung said that its new technology reaches speeds of up to 1000 MB / s, which will allow transferring Full HD video of 5 GB in just five seconds, rather than in one minute, as is the case with a regular microSD card.  Increased memory will also provide higher quality video with high resolution due to a higher random read speed. <br><br>  All this sounds nice, of course, but will the company be able to present it to the public before the end of this year?  According to <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/2019/01/29/12gb-galaxy-s10-plus-1tb-storage-rumor">rumors</a> , Samsung may present a version of the new Galaxy Note 10 with a volume of 1 TB, but at this stage there is no concrete evidence. </div>
