The idea is clear: AMD has promised to use the 7 nm process technology in new products starting in 2019.  The first representatives of the 7 nm processor will be the 3rd generation Ryzen for desktop PCs with Zen 2 cores, and more than enough performance to compete with the best hardware Intel.  In addition, the company plans to return its position in the segment of high-performance graphics cards, since AMD is going to release a 7-nm graphics card that can compete in the price range of about $ 700. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  AMD at CES 2019 </h2><br>  During the show this year, the AMD report looked a bit strange.  Usually the company makes one major press release for one report, revealing all the details of the new product.  This year, AMD began with news about mobile processors of the Ryzen-3000 series and AMD's Chromebook, as soon as the show opened, and we were confused, taking it as the main announcement.  It would be strange, in the end, for the company to "pre-announce future announcements."  Fortunately, AMD does have a story to tell. <br><br>  First of all, processors.  AMD introduced the next-generation 7-nm desktop processor, the Ryzen 3rd Generation. <br><br><h3>  Attack on the mainstream processor market: nostril to nostril with Core i9-9900K </h3><br>  Forget everything you may have heard about the future AMD desktop processor.  Here are most of the details you need to know. <br><br>  New processors codenamed Matisse will hit the market in mid-2019 (somewhere in Q2 or Q3).  The processor, which the company demonstrated, consists of two silicon matrices in one package: one 8-core 7-nm chipset made by the TSMC campaign, and a 14-nm I / O chip with two memory controllers and PCIe lines made in GlobalFoundries. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sr/rj/bz/srrjbzqs0i2qa-_prnxwa8csimu.png"><br><br>  The company said that this is the world's first 7-nm gaming processor, as well as the world's first mainframe processor with support for PCIe 4.0 x16.  Currently, the company does not comment on whether the 3rd generation will have a maximum of eight cores, and whether the presented processor is the best model in the line. <br><br>  Since the processor is still far from running, the frequencies were not announced.  Nevertheless, the processor is designed for socket AM4, given that AMD had previously announced that it intends to maintain backward compatibility for several generations.  Consequently, this processor will run on AMD 300 and 400 series motherboards. <br><br>  As for PCIe 4.0, in fact, everything is pretty obvious.  We expect that a new line of motherboards will appear, presumably something like the X570, will be compatible with PCIe 4.0 (with the ability to support any new PCIe 4.0 video cards that will appear on the market).  One of the differences between PCIe 4.0 is that it can only work with PCB tracks up to 7 inches long, and then you need to redirect and retimer, which means that these additional chips are necessary for the ports on the board.  But the first PCIe slot on most motherboards is within 7 inches, so it can turn out that many modern motherboards of the 300 and 400 series (provided that the tracks meet the signal integrity specifications) can have their first PCIe slot with a PCIe 4.0 rating after the upgrade. firmware. <br><br><h3>  Talk about size </h3><br>  As we can see in the above picture, the 8-core chipset is smaller than the IO-crystal, similar to the design of the 8 + 1 chipset on EPYC.  Given that the size of an IO-crystal is not exactly a quarter of an EPYC IO-crystal, as I predicted, this may be a hint of an announcement of a server processor in Rome.  The size of the new IO crystal is ‚Äúsomewhere‚Äù somewhere between a quarter and a half of EPYC. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mt/hi/dl/mthidl9jvj-lrmthmykmgdciaa8.png"><br><br>  By performing some measurements on our photograph of the processor, and knowing that the AM4 processor has an area of ‚Äã‚Äã40 mm, we measured the chiplet as 10.53 x 7.67 mm = 80.80 square meters.  mm, while the size of the input-output crystal is 13.16 x 9.32 mm = 122.63 sq. mm. <br><br><h3>  + 15% to performance in the transition to a new generation, at least </h3><br>  During the main announcement, AMD demonstrated the performance indicators of the 3rd generation Ryzen (Matisse).  The results of the Cinebench R15 test were reviewed. <br><br>  Our internal tests show that the second generation Ryzen 7 2700X is gaining 1754 points. <br>  The new Ryzen processor of the 3rd generation scored 2023 points. <br><br>  This means that with the current, not yet finally confirmed frequencies, the new processors provide an increase in performance by 15.3% compared with the previous generation.  The Cinebench test is an ideal situation for AMD, but the result will change with changes in frequencies.  In general, the performance will depend on the workload, and this is an interesting point for further research. <br><br><h3>  Same performance as Core i9-9900K, minimum </h3><br>  On testing, Anandtech 9900K scored 2032 points. <br><br>  According to AMD, their 8-core processor scored 2023, and the Intel Core i9-9900K - 2042. <br>  Both systems worked with strong air cooling, and we were told that the Core i9-9900K worked at standard frequencies on the ASUS motherboard.  The AMD chip, on the contrary, did not work on the latest frequencies.  AMD says both test systems have identical power supplies, DRAM, SSD, operating systems, patches, and both with a Vega 64 video card. <br><br><h3>  Slightly more than half the power ...?! </h3><br>  In addition, according to the results of the same test, the power consumption of the system was determined.  This includes a motherboard, DRAM, SSD, and so on.  Since the systems were supposedly identical, the results relate precisely to a comparison of CPU consumption.  Intel system during testing Cinebench worked at 180 watts.  This result corresponds to what we saw in our systems, and it looks right.  The AMD system, on the other hand, worked on 130-132 watts. <br><br>  If we recall the average power consumption of the system in the idle mode of our own reviews, which is about 55 watts, then we determine the power of the Intel processor - about 125 watts, while the AMD processor - about 75 watts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hi/fm/a5/hifma5stwtii4nj8anhlfugxcrc.png"><br>  * A rough estimate based on our previous testing. <br><br>  This suggests that new AMD processors with the same number of cores give about the same performance (in some performance tests) to the better mainstream Intel processor, while consuming much less power.  Almost half the energy. <br><br>  This is a serious bid to win. <br><br><h3>  How did AMD do it?  IPC or frequency? </h3><br>  We know something about the new Zen 2 microarchitecture. We know that it has an improved branch prediction module and an improved prefetcher, better micro-operation cache management, an increased micro-operation cache, an increased throughput of the dispatcher, an increased throughput of retire instructions, 256-bit support built in. floating-point maths, double FMA blocks and double the load-store units.  These last three facts are key elements for the Cinebench benchmark, and work well in favor of AMD. <br><br>  Since the Intel processor was allowed to work as standard, even on the ASUS motherboard, it should reach about 4.7 GHz turbo on all cores.  AMD processor frequencies are unknown;  but they are also not final, and we "must expect more."  Well, if the processor only worked at 75 watts, and they can overclock it by another 20-30 watts, then there will be even more frequency and performance. <br><br>  One thing we don‚Äôt know yet is how well the 7nm TSMC handles the increase in voltage and frequency.  The only 7 nm chips that currently exist are chips for smartphones with a clock frequency of less than 3 GHz.  There is simply nothing to compare with - one can assume that in order to compete with the Core i9-9900K, the processor would have to have an all-core frequency (4.7 GHz) if it were on the same IPC. <br><br>  If the processor cannot match in IPC or frequency, then three options are possible: <br><br><ol><li>  If the TSMC process cannot operate at such high frequencies, then AMD is noticeably ahead of Intel in IPC, which will lead to a significant change in modern x86 hardware. </li><li>  If the TSMC process can work with a clock frequency higher than 5.0 GHz, and there is a reserve in the power budget for an even greater increase, then it will be very funny to see what these processors will be capable of in the end. </li><li>  AMD Hyperthreading is driving programs like CineBench crazy. </li></ol><br><h3>  Third-generation AMD Ryzen processors - another step forward </h3><br>  During a conversation with AMD, their representative said that as we get closer to the launch, more information will be provided.  They are happy that users are discussing whether IPC or frequency is the secret of AMD processor performance, and will disclose information closer to release time. <br><br><h3>  Ian, I thought you predicted two chiplets? </h3><br>  Naturally, I assumed that AMD will introduce a desktop processor series Ryzen-3000 with sixteen cores.  For me and many others, this was a natural progress, but today we are saying that AMD mentions only an eight-core chip. <br><br>  I was mistaken with the prediction, and I lost my money (note: no less in Las Vegas).  But if we look at the processor, the intrigue is still there. <br><br>  There is a place for something else.  There is not much space there, but I'm sure that if AMD wants, there will be another processor chip (or GPU chip) in this package.  Then the question of frequency and power will rise again. <br><br>  There is also the issue of processors with fewer cores for a cheaper market segment.  The new processor uses silicon from TSMC, made in Taiwan, and GlobalFoundries, made in New York, then packed together.  We heard the opinion of people not working in the industry that such an approach makes cheap processors (less than $ 100) less appropriate.  It is possible that AMD will be able to enter this market with the help of future graphics processors. <br><br>  What are AMD's future plans, I do not know.  I do not have a magic crystal ball.  But it seems that AMD has room to grow in the future. <br><br>  Thank you for staying with us.  Do you like our articles?  Want to see more interesting materials?
