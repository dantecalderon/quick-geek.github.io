<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Habré has recently regularly published articles devoted to finding work outside of the Russian Federation, Ukraine and the CIS and the subsequent move to another country.  In my opinion, they adequately talk about the vicissitudes of finding a potential employer, concluding a contract, passing the necessary formalities and paperwork, planning and preparing for the move.  But what they usually keep silent about or forget to mention, or bypass - is an adaptation to new realities, cultural environment, life in a new unfamiliar society.  “Cultural shock”, which is certainly talked about, including in state integration programs available at the place of residence, is unbearable for many, and if such a thing is notified to a potential IT emigrant in advance, it will be easier for him to adapt.  Or, perhaps, he will change his decision to leave for the chosen country and look for more attractive places to move, or he will completely abandon his intention to change his country of residence in the near future. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This article is devoted to the description of such “spoonfuls of tar”, which in the life of a new immigrant can accumulate on a whole bucket.  I will give examples of Canada as an example, but the cultural characteristics described are also characteristic of the United States and most Western European countries. <br><br>  <b>Legalization of marijuana and items for taking light drugs.</b>  The use of marijuana for "medical purposes" is becoming more common.  <a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/toronto-election/2018/08/14/dont-open-more-drug-injection-sites-here-downtown-city-councillor-says.html">Petty crime is becoming increasingly common</a> .  In addition to shops for the legal sale of marijuana, special points are also opened where drug addicts have the opportunity to receive a “dose”.  And if you are “lucky” at a new place to settle nearby (within 2-3 blocks) from such points - you cannot see a quiet life, and at any time of the day your and your family’s personal safety may be threatened.  Once a gin, once released from a bottle, as practice shows, it is no longer so easy to shove back and achieve the closure or transfer of drug-taking points or marijuana shops to the residents of the community if it succeeds, then with great difficulty, many even have to move themselves, to- anything far away <br><br>  <b>Hygiene standards.</b>  You need to be prepared for the different hygiene standards adopted by immigrants who come from different countries.  A Chinese sitting across from you at an office dining table can belch very loudly;  during working hours in the toilet, you can stumble upon a Muslim washing his feet in the sink before the prayer;  in many latrines in restaurants and cafes there will be no soap supplies and / or hot water (and in general, toilets in Canada are just silent horror; in large Russian cities, cafes with such “latrines” would simply go bankrupt in a few months due to lack of customers) . <br><br>  <b>Separate toilets for people with an "unspecified" sexual orientation</b> and taxes on their construction.  At the same time, the cleanliness of ordinary public toilets leaves much to be desired, businesses are forced to spend money not on putting them in order or maintaining proper cleanliness in them, but on redeveloping them, in order to make room for separate latrines for “trans- genders "in order not to infringe upon their" rights ".  According to the new construction standards in each new building being erected in the public area there should be three, not two, as before, restrooms: for men, for women and for “other”.  Consider that the arrangement of such “other” toilets in existing or as yet unbuilt buildings will leave a part of your taxes. <br><br>  <b>Wage discrimination for the sexiest people.</b>  If you get a job in a large corporation in the United States, it is very likely that, within the framework of the established salary grid, the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/google-raises-eyebrows-with-new-gay-only-employee-benefit">amount of remuneration you receive will be lower</a> than the salary of a worker next to you and a non-traditional sexual orientation representative who does the same.  This practice is due to the fact that these highly decent people are at risk of various diseases, including  HIV, and for this reason, health insurance companies either deny them insurance or set higher insurance rates.  The resulting difference in tariffs large employers (Google, Facebook, Apple) compensate to equalize the full size of salaries.  In other words, instead of paying various compensations to employees who have children, the budgets of organizations, on the contrary, are spent on paying “benefits” to childless homosexuals and lesbians - this is a modern cultural feature of many Western countries. <br><br>  <b>Excessive reverence for members of "sex minorities."</b>  "Patsaki chatlanam sat on his head", and for a long time and thoroughly.  In Canada, they even say that if you share traditional values, you should not come to Canada.  Point. <br>  I believe that this is true not only for Canada, but also for other Western countries.  You can’t manage to actively fight against forcibly inculcated and promoted opinion and somehow influence, even in the conditions of a properly functioning democratic system, if you just show your point of view without negative consequences for yourself (see below). sex education and political correctness);  this is not even possible for the “opposition” minded indigenous people, what can we say about the newly arrived immigrant. <br><br>  <b>Sex education.</b>  Schools in the West have introduced so-called sex education, in which, as is well known, children are told not only about pistils and stamens.  In the countries that are most advanced in terms of diverse sex, explanations about same-sex love were also introduced into the program of this training. Moreover, children from the age of 7-8 years old tell about it, and in especially “advanced” countries or provinces - even from kindergarten -6 years. <br><br>  Even more concerned with the sexual education of society, they went even further in terms of “fighting discrimination” and require all organizations, including preschool institutions and kindergartens, to choose the “other” sex when registering with their IP via the Internet.  Therefore, when you enroll your 5-year-old child in kindergarten, be ready to see the “other” option in the “Sex” field besides the standard values ​​“male” and “female”.  But this is not all that will await you culturally in terms of raising your own children. <br><br>  In Canada, it is planned to introduce changes in legislation, in accordance with which the child, starting at the age of 5, will be able to require his parents to perform a sex change operation on him or her.  In accordance with some of the proposed provisions of this legislation, parents, in case of refusal of the child to pay for and conduct such an operation, may be deprived of parental rights. <br><br>  It is not surprising, therefore, that <a href="https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/one-in-six-ontario-parents-considered-pulling-kids-from-school-over-new-sex-ed-curriculum-poll">many parents, by any means possible for them, try to protect their children from the similar cultural influence of the environment</a> in which they find themselves.  Someone gives their children to study in religious, "Catholic" schools, knowing that, at least for today, the curriculum in such schools does not contain the "subject" described above.  Many immigrants send their children back to their homeland.  I personally know several Russian and Ukrainian couples who have made such a decision, and I also know about several Iranians who did the same.  (And those Iranians are not religious obscurantists at all, but quite modern people who simply do not accept ultra-liberal values ​​actively promoted in Western society.) Stop your attention for a minute and think about this important moment: educated and modern people, atheists who never believed in any gods are forced to give their children to study in the "seminary" or send them back for many years to live and study in a country ruled by religious fanatics, if only they would not wash the brain of the current ultra-lev  th propaganda! <br><br>  The issue of education, even preschool, for your children is an extremely important issue.  Therefore, here I will note another point, which usually is not thought “on the shore”, before leaving: does your family have a single point of view on the subject of sex education and attitude to “sexual minorities”?  If so, how durable is it? <br><br>  There are cases when on arrival at a new place of residence, after immersing in the local culture, communicating with native people, attending immigrant courses, one of the marital parties declared another: “Do you know, darling, I think that there is nothing terrible and it will be quite normal if our child grows up to be homosexual or lesbian. ”  Typically, women are more susceptible to such changes in attitudes and worldviews - they are known to be more tolerant and tolerant by nature than men (by the way, for such a comment made at an office dinner, some feminist colleague can really take you to court or simply complain to the personnel department, followed by your dismissal and very, very difficult to find a new job, because the last employer will provide negative feedback about you as a “sexist” - keep this in mind) and you, n  Aver, it is worth thinking about it or even better - to talk together "on the coast" in order to avoid unpleasant discoveries, surprises, disappointments and dramas in the future. <br><br>  <b>Discrimination when hiring for content in profiles in social networks.</b>  If on any socio-cultural issue described above, your position will not coincide with the “generally accepted,” although it would be more correct to characterize that as “imposed by ultra-left propaganda,” and you will express it in your blog or social media profile. face tangible difficulties when looking for a job (even though you are an IT person).  Large organizations like Sberbank, MegaFon or Gazprom, before hiring an employee, are sure to investigate his or her past;  checks on non-conviction and lack of financial debts in the last 3-5 years have been added to checks in social networks.  Specialized agencies wool profiles of potential employees on Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, and if there are notes, pictures or simply links to other resources that express a position that does not correlate with the officially declared position of the organization in which you are trying to find a job. <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2018/11/23/dark-horse-brewery-fires-employee-facebook-post/2094148002/">you are already working</a> - <a href="https://www.thestar.com/business/personal_finance/2012/05/10/canada_post_clerk_fired_for_nasty_facebook_posts.html">this organization</a> will refuse to <a href="https://careers.workopolis.com/advice/14-canadians-who-were-fired-for-social-media-posts/">cooperate with you</a> .  Business has become very sensitive, no one needs a negative publicity, corporations are extremely wary of negative opinions about themselves in the mass media and avoid or get rid of employees, whose points of view even in personal life run counter to "generally accepted".  The recent case of one of the Mozill executives is the most famous and simple example. <br><br>  <b>Political correctness.</b>  And in general, be prepared for the fact that if you are a person with fair skin, married to individuals of the opposite sex, with an annual income above the average (and you, as an IT specialist from a former USSR country, this is what you will be), every time you need to exaggeration to think ten times before expressing, even among friends and acquaintances, any point of view different from the main stream, whether it is a restriction of immigration, a restriction of the growing rights of "sex minorities", the onset of feminism, etc.  Otherwise, in the worst case, you can lose your job, and with it a bright future in the newly acquired homeland (see above), and at best - be branded with various social justice warriors * as one or another "... fob", while some of them and in general, they can descend to loudly declare to you that the government of the country where you moved should have denied you an entry visa, because you do not share any "generally accepted" social or cultural "values".  My reasoning may seem unfounded and overly blackens the society of Western democracy, but I will not go into details, but only recommend those interested and doubting to google or love the keywords "suppression of freedom of speech", "Prof.  Dr.  Jordan Peterson, et al. <br><br>  * <i>Social justice warriors</i> are generally an absolute nightmare, an ultra-liberal inquisition of the 21st century, hiding behind in each case a new invention called “hate-speech crime”.  Do not say later that before leaving you did not warn you of their existence ... <br><br>  <b>Social grievance.</b>  Also be prepared for the fact that any of your harsh or insufficiently correct and streamlined statement on almost any occasion can be perceived by anyone as an attempt to offend, “hurt feelings”.  Negro teenager, fat man, lesbian, mentally ill - any of them can find fault with any of your words spoken in a public place (and even among friends) or on the Internet.  Such social groups have institutions that defend their “rights in the current state of Western society” —individual social justice warriors and whole organizations investigating the degree of their “oppression”.  In particular, the need is imposed to use special pronouns when addressing persons of the “other” gender, in order “not to infringe upon those persons in their rights”.  In all seriousness, books are published, studies are conducted, lectures are given.  For example, at the University of New York, a professor gives a course of lectures on “the presence of 24 (!) Different sexes in homo sapience”.  (It would be interesting to ask him a question - what, for each such “gender”, will mankind have to invent and learn 22 sets of new pronouns?) <br><br>  The case in the cultural and social plan goes so far that in an academic environment, scientists question the very meaning of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25C2%25AB%25D0%2598%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25C2%25BB">study of</a> such "offended" groups and individuals.  <a href="https://areomagazine.com/2018/10/02/academic-grievance-studies-and-the-corruption-of-scholarship/">“Academic Grievance Studies and the Corruption of Scholarship”</a> is a very interesting article about this, perfectly revealing the degree of idiocy created in modern Western culture and social sciences, I highly recommend reading it before buying a plane ticket: even if you have a contract and a visa is issued , your decision to leave without exaggeration may well falter after reading it. <br><hr>  Of course, in life in the Western cultural environment there is a fair amount of positive moments, many of which are described with other degrees of reliability in other articles on Habré.  Nevertheless, without showing a small part of the back side of the medal, the picture remains clearly incomplete. <br><br>  I hope that the part of the Habr audience that “starts the tractor” or thinks about it, the information given in the article will be interesting and may even be useful. <br><br>  PS Readers who believe that the article was written by the Olginsky Troll, the author asks to refrain from writing unnecessary and inappropriate comments. </div>
