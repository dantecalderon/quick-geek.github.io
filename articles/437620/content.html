<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The desire to save lives and preserve health is one of the most important engines of progress.  In the information age there are more and more new opportunities for medical institutions and the development of science.  Many of these opportunities came from the adaptation of this cloud area.  Tell about this in more detail in today's material. <br><br> <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/1cloud/blog/437620/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rc/1f/p0/rc1fp0-2ace2wswpxdgwhazyc8k.jpeg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>/ Flickr / National Eye Institute / <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC BY</a></i></font> <br><br><h2>  Sea of ​​data </h2><br>  The quality of medical services directly depends on the level of analysis of data collected at various stages of research or practical activities in this area.  According <a href="https://www.emc.com/analyst-report/digital-universe-healthcare-vertical-report-ar.pdf">to the</a> IDC <a href="https://www.emc.com/analyst-report/digital-universe-healthcare-vertical-report-ar.pdf">report</a> , the annual increase in medical data is 48%, which draws new medical requirements.  institutions to storage capacity and IT infrastructure.  Several factors "respond" to the growth of indicators in this area: <br><br>  <b>Scientific activity is developing rapidly</b> .  The frequency of the emergence of new scientific publications, which are guided by doctors and manufacturers of honey.  equipment, unprecedented.  It is expected that by 2020 the volume of medical information <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/connect/medical-knowledge-doubles-every-few-months-how-can-clinicians-keep-up">will double every 70 days</a> . <br><br>  <b>There are new ways to collect data</b> .  Mobile devices for monitoring and diagnostics are becoming sources of important statistics, allowing you to make correct and timely diagnoses.  For example, Aruba, a subsidiary of HP, <a href="https://www.arubanetworks.com/assets/infographic/Aruba_IoT_Healthcare_Infographic.pdf">claims</a> that already this year, 87% of US health care providers will use IoT solutions. <br><br>  <b>More patients - more data</b> .  It is impossible to forget about the aging population of developed countries.  Life expectancy is rising - not least because of the quality and affordable medical services.  As a result, the burden (including information) on the health care system is only increasing. <br><br>  All this complicates the processing of medical data, as well as their storage and, importantly, protection.  For example, last year's <a href="http://go.thalesesecurity.com/rs/480-LWA-970/images/2018-Thales-Data-Threat-Report-Healthcare-Edition-ar.pdf">study of the</a> Thales Group showed that data leakage is not uncommon in medical organizations. <br><br><h2>  What will help cloud technology </h2><br>  Cloud technologies give healthcare organizations the chance to rethink their workflows and cope with the challenges and problems described above.  Let's see what changes in the field of health care are taking place thanks to the new infrastructure. <br><br>  <b>Simplified exchange of medical information</b> .  Medical organizations have to store a huge amount of information about patients: medical history, cardiograms, x-rays, CT scans, etc. To cope with this amount of data, more and more countries are gradually <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168851018303245">introducing</a> so-called electronic medical records based on cloud technologies. <br><br>  All patient data is digitized and placed on a remote server in the cloud of an <a href="https://1cloud.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dcpm%26utm_campaign%3Dmed%26utm_content%3Dsite">IaaS provider</a> .  There they are securely protected using encryption algorithms and backup systems.  At the same time, access to patient data can be obtained by authorized health care providers at any clinic in the country.  Thus, a person does not have to start a medical record in every medical institution where he goes, and it is easier for doctors to work with a medical history. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fb/5x/_z/fb5x_zdckgadaywcii6jv0zifrq.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>/ Flickr / <a href="https://pxhere.com/en/photo/1192464">PxHere</a> PD</i></font> <br><br>  Clouds also make it easier for pharmaceutical companies to interact with other organizations.  For example, Pfeizer <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/industries/health-sciences/clinical-data-warehouse-innovation-2272369.pdf">already uses a</a> cloud-based platform for storing confidential medical information from partner laboratories.  <a href="https://1cloud.ru/services/storage%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dcpm%26utm_campaign%3Dmed%26utm_content%3Dsite">Cloud storage</a> with metrics and metadata helps them conduct 800 clinical trials of medications annually. <br><br>  <b>New analytical tools are emerging</b> .  Integration of cloud analytical systems with electronic patient data directories will allow for more research projects.  Former director of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Clinic">Cleveland Clinic</a> Toby Cosgrove (Toby Cosgrove) in a <a href="https://youtu.be/N9mdn3nI3HM">recent interview</a> said that it is automated data processing on cloud platforms will be the key to improving the efficiency of medical institutions. <br><br>  An example would be genetic studies of autism.  The data collected by the Autism Speaks Foundation (more than <a href="https://cloud.google.com/genomics/resources/google-genomics-whitepaper.pdf">one hundred terabytes</a> ) is processed on the Google Genomics cloud platform.  It uses solutions like BigQuery to analyze big data on Apache Spark, Cloud Dataflow or Oracle Grid Engine clusters. <br><br>  Researchers claim that such projects will lead to the development of technologies at the intersection of genetics and medicine.  In the United States, <a href="http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/medicalschool/administration/alumni/CUMedToday/profiles/Pages/Personalized-Medicine-Center.aspx">a</a> “ <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/08/10/personalized-medicine-a-culmination-of-everything-the-digital-economy-has-to-offer/%252374fe3fe91740">personalized medicine</a> ” center has already <a href="http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/medicalschool/administration/alumni/CUMedToday/profiles/Pages/Personalized-Medicine-Center.aspx">appeared</a> , making up a treatment program based on the patient’s genetic data.  Speaking of treatment ... <br><br>  <b>Changing approaches to the diagnosis of patients</b> .  The cloud goes hand in hand with mobile technology, allowing you to remotely do something that previously required a personal presence.  For this, medical facilities place in the cloud a system for exchanging medical data and even solutions for video conferencing.  Telemedicine services are often built on the basis of the latter. <br><br>  Patients can now receive medical advice from the comfort of their homes, which especially helps people with disabilities.  Analysts <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/671374/global-telemedicine-market-size/">say</a> that in the next couple of years the cost of the telemedicine market will reach $ 40 billion. <br><br>  At the same time, technologies are being developed that should help doctors with the formulation of “remote” diagnoses.  Israeli company Beyond Verbal in September 2016 <a href="https://www.mobihealthnews.com/content/beyond-verbal-launches-research-platform-leverage-health-detecting-voice-analytics-software">presented a</a> project based on an AI system capable of diagnosing diseases according to the voice of the patient.  Its task is to recognize intonational nuances that a person cannot determine by ear.  The solution was taught in two million audio recordings with voices speaking 40 different languages. <br><br>  Another direction of development is smart devices of the Internet of things.  Cloud computing provides the infrastructure for these innovations.  They allow doctors to <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263464098_Internet_of_Things_Remote_Patient_Monitoring_Using_Web_Services_and_Cloud_Computing">remotely monitor the</a> health of patients, reducing the burden on hospitals and response time to emergency events.  An experiment conducted in Britain ten years ago showed a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_patient_monitoring%2523Whole_System_Demonstrator_Trial_in_UK">45% reduction in mortality</a> among patients using remote monitoring devices. <br><br>  The development of cloud technologies and the Internet of things has led to the emergence of large medical gadgets.  At the end of the summer of 2017, Band-Aid <a href="https://iot.ru/meditsina/vypushcheno-miniatyurnoe-nosimoe-ustroystvo-razmerom-s-plastyr">released an “smart” patch</a> that will allow doctors to obtain data on the health of people in rural and hard-to-reach areas, where, as a rule, medicine is poorly developed. <br><br>  Cloud technologies also make it easier for patients to diagnose a disease.  In particular, now, to get the results of the tests, you do not need a personal visit to the doctor - you can find them out via the Internet.  Web portals for patients are becoming the norm, and even if by old habit, <a href="https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/patient-portals-still-largely-unused-health-affairs-finds/543616/">not everyone</a> uses them, in the future we can expect their mass adaptation. <br><br><hr><br>  <i>PS For now, we can only see the first steps in the field of “cloud medicine” - over time, this trend will develop faster and faster.</i>  <i>And now among the clients of 1cloud.ru you can find companies engaged in the provision of medical services, development of medical equipment and drugs.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>An example is the HELIX laboratory service.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Many technological solutions, which are currently being developed, will become industry standards in the future and will have a serious impact on treatment approaches.</i> <br><br><hr><br><h5>  Where else will the cloud help: </h5><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://1cloud.ru/blog/kak-iaas-pomogaet-1c-franchisee%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dcpm%26utm_campaign%3Dmed%26utm_content%3Dblog">How IaaS helps 1C franchisee: 1cloud experience</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://1cloud.ru/blog/intervju-s-klientom-1cloud-marketing%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dcpm%26utm_campaign%3Dmed%26utm_content%3Dblog">Guerrilla Marketing: Customer Interview</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://1cloud.ru/blog/intervju-s-klientom-1cloud-1c%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dcpm%26utm_campaign%3Dmed%26utm_content%3Dblog">How 1cloud makes life easier for 1C developer</a> </li></ul></div>
