It is time for the fair half to receive gifts.  We are of the opinion that gifts should be given not only on February 23 or March 8.  But still, if there is some official date, a holiday - why not pay tribute to the tradition and please your loved ones or colleagues? <br><br>  What to give a girl on March 8, except for flowers?  Let's try to find a solution. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Drawing Tablet with LCD Pic-Pad </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dm1V8XS0JD8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Pic-Pad is a great gift for a little lady.  This is a drawing tablet equipped with a touch-sensitive LCD screen with a touch sensor and a stylus.  The pressure sensor allows you to adjust the thickness of the lines, and you can erase the drawing with one touch of a button. <br><br>  In the menu, you can choose a color, as well as a tool, including an eraser.  In order not to erase the picture by accident, the tablet has a screen lock function.  It is small (slightly less than A4 paper), so you can take a pic-pad with you on any trip. <br><br>  In fact, the tablet is an improved (at the expense of the LCD screen) board “Write-Erase”, the peak of which popularity fell on the 90s. <br><br>  You can buy a tablet <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/pic-pad/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26amp%3Butm_medium%3Dpr%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3D8marta">here</a> , and for the promo code 4LADIES get a discount of 15%.

This lamp will serve as a wonderful decoration for both office and home.  Its feature is the absence of wires at the lamp itself.

Get used to such a lamp is difficult, but possible. <br><br>  You can purchase a 10% <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/lesvet/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26amp%3Butm_medium%3Dpr%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3D8marta">discount</a> . <br><br><h3>  Battery-Powered XD Collection Electric Wine Corkscrew </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/g3/j3/nb/g3j3nbqk73dooewscdquvnck_jm.jpeg"><br><br>  A corkscrew may seem like a strange gift, but if you think about it, it’s a great option for women.  After all, the classic corkscrew often does not obey fragile female hands.  And even if a girl drinks wine extremely rarely, sometimes gatherings with friends, girlfriends happen, when wine is almost an obligatory attribute.  The usual corkscrew is not very convenient, but the electric battery from the XD Collection on batteries unscrews the cork from the bottle with one touch in just 8 seconds. <br><br>  The <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/xd-collection-p911411/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26amp%3Butm_medium%3Dpr%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3D8marta">corkscrew</a> discount <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/xd-collection-p911411/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26amp%3Butm_medium%3Dpr%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3D8marta">is 20%</a> . <br><br><h3>  Backpack for laptop up to 14 inches XD Design Bobby Compact </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/en/la/v8/enlav82hav550pphcziqwgncbhw.jpeg"><br><br>  And again our beloved Bobby.  By the way, so often in our selections he meets because we have most of the office with him (and now also friends, relatives, acquaintances).  And if you're looking for a backpack, then you can count on the fact that the XD Design Bobby Compact is ideal. <br><br>  Backpack is anti-vandal, difficult to cut or open.  It fits a 14-inch laptop, as well as several gadgets and the most necessary things.  It is small, which means that girls will appreciate it.  Moreover, there are 5 bright colors for every taste. <br><br>  Buy a backpack with a 20% discount <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/xd-design-bobby-compact/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26amp%3Butm_medium%3Dpr%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3D8marta">here</a> . <br><br><h3>  Smart lighting system Nanoleaf Aurora Smarter Kit </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lhUBRxabhxk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Smart lighting system is ideal for interior renovation.  Nanoleaf is a set of 9 LED RGBW panels.  The panels are made in the form of triangles and from them you can lay out different geometric shapes, even on the ceiling, even on the walls.  The modular design allows to collect up to 30 panels.  Power is supplied only to one panel, and then along the chain is transmitted along all the others. <br><br>  Panels are controlled from an iOS or Android mobile device.  Additionally, you can purchase the Nanoleaf Aurora Rhythm music module and then the panels will be able to adjust to the beats and rhythms of the sounding music in the room (depending on the volume, rhythm and beats, the frequency of hue changes and the brightness of the panels change).  All together it looks epic and fascinates those present in the room: tested on Madrobots employees, who only a month later learned to calmly walk past the wonder panels. <br><br>  In honor of the holiday discount on the panels Nanoleaf <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/nanoleaf-aurora-smarter-kit/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26amp%3Butm_medium%3Dpr%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3D8marta">- 10%</a> . <br><br><h3>  Sleepace Sleep Dot B502T Sleep Tracker </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OJVPDKqJw0A" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Want to know how good or bad you sleep?
