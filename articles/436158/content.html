This is not just a work of art, but a normal functioning system. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In his video, the author says that the mouse body is printed on a 3D printer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sy/vc/ax/syvcaxf6aepjl-h152wcoosixou.jpeg"><br><br>  The case is comparable in size with a conventional peripheral device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9t/8i/hw/9t8ihwaptkymcznie75272tslzc.jpeg"><br><br>  Inside, a Raspberry Pi microcontroller and several mouse components fit in to make the buttons and scroll wheel work properly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9r/2e/d-/9r2ed-y_uh2ludylubomwhcftzg.jpeg"><br><br>  Attached to the side is a tiny display, and at the bottom - a sliding keyboard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xn/ik/l0/xnikl0dn5a7ssybb7ubm9keri0c.jpeg"><br><br>  “Although the screen is attached, because of the sensitivity of the mouse, it’s not so difficult to monitor what is happening on the screen at the same time,” says <i>Electronic Grenade</i> . <br><br>  But the author acknowledges the disadvantages.  Some resource-intensive applications sometimes fail.  For example, Minecraft sometimes freezes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/r9/4z/sg/r94zsgpcrcbb2yiiy1ljmtpbdia.jpeg"><br><br>  The sliding keyboard is also not very convenient to use, it is quite possible to type with your fingers, not a stylus.  True, you only have to type with one hand, holding it in an uncomfortable position, because the keyboard is at a 90 ° angle to the screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7e/sb/bw/7esbbwojwvkpcl8haqdiqz_7hbq.jpeg"><br><br>  It is not entirely clear whether to correctly call this computer a desktop computer, or is it a laptop.  In any case, this is a very interesting application of the Raspberry Pi. </div>
