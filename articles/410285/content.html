<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The Federal Aviation Administration of the United States launched an investigation into the incident, which could be the first crash involving a multicopter.  On February 14, the Robinson R22 helicopter fell to the southern tip of Daniel Island in Charleston, South Carolina, USA.  According to the pilot, the cause of the crash was a white drone, supposedly DJI Phantom, who was in the helicopter’s way. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/714/224/8ae/7142248ae60b699744646f1a28567100.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Some time ago it became apparent that the aircrafts and drones were getting cramped.  Increasingly, there were reports of dangerous incidents involving drones, which can be read on GT in the 2015 article <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/mvideo/blog/263874/">“Dron in law.</a>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/mvideo/blog/263874/">Fly, but remember</a> . <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/mvideo/blog/263874/">”</a> <br><blockquote>  If the FAA prohibits the use of drones for commercial purposes, and for amateurs not to launch drones above 400 feet (approximately 120 meters), then in Russian legislation the wording is more blurred. <br></blockquote><br><blockquote>  Thus, despite the threat of a fine, this situation has perfectly demonstrated a hole in the legislation. </blockquote><br>  It took two years for Russian legislation to decide on this issue and in October and December 2017, two owners of quadcopters DJI FANTOM 4 were fined 3,000 rubles ( <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/296413/">“Launched a roader - received a fine”</a> ) for “unauthorized launching and piloting an unmanned aircraft” . <br><br>  The scale of the problem in the United States by 2017 reached a level when <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/291631/">the United States Air Force wanted to get the right to shoot down civilian drones</a> in order to protect expensive military equipment from damage or destruction by drones. <br><br>  The US Federal Aviation Administration reports an increasing number of dangerous incidents and violations of flight rules by “drone pilots”.  At the end of 2017, the Federal Office summed up the results - an average of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-28/faa-warns-of-drone-collision-risks-with-airplanes-as-use-grows">about 250 incidents per month</a> , which is 50% more than in 2016. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/85c/c4d/f9f/85cc4df9f04e0ff161d6577c9b50a78f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In most cases, it is not possible to establish the owner of the multicopter.  The exception was the case in New York on September 21, 2017, when the drone damaged a military helicopter.  The owner has been installed according to the part numbers of the multicopter. <br><br>  In February 2018, a video from a drone that flew several meters from an airliner in Las Vegas, which caused outrage on the Internet, prompted three influential American aviation lobbies to demand more stringent rules for UAVs from Congress. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u8n1TIX02zg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Until recently, incidents were safely resolved, but this time the crash of the aircraft took place.  The incident is reported by the American media, for example, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-16/what-may-be-first-drone-linked-copter-crash-being-investigated">Bloomberg</a> , <a href="https://www.postandcourier.com/news/report-helicopter-crash-on-daniel-island-may-have-been-caused/article_1123767a-12a7-11e8-bf2e-2798e681cd6b.html">Post and Courier.</a> <br><br>  According to the instructor pilot of the company Holy City Helicopters, on February 14, he worked with a student to maneuver a Robinson R22 helicopter over undeveloped land plots, when at about 2 pm, suddenly a white DJI Phantom appeared in front of them.  In an effort to avoid a dangerous collision with the drone, the instructor took control, but the tail of the helicopter caught a small tree or branch.  As a result, the helicopter lost control, fell and fell over on its side.  The crew was not injured, the helicopter was damaged. </div>
