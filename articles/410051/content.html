But the laws of the market has not been canceled.  If the occupation is very profitable, many outsiders come here (even the staff of Sberbank <a href="http://www.interfax.ru/business/598904">mined altcoins at work</a> , at the peak of the course, members of the All-Russian Research Institute of Experimental Physics in Sarov did the same).  As more people begin mining, the complexity of the calculation increases and the profit margin returns to its normal value.  This happened with cryptocurrencies and this time, especially now the process of correction has accelerated due to the fall in the exchange rate. <br><br>  According to Avito statistics, the Russians started selling equipment for mining, they <a href="https://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2018/02/08/750393-rossiyane-stali-chasche-prodavat-oborudovanie-dlya-maininga-kriptovalyut">write</a> "Vedomosti".  In January 2018, the number of ads on this topic increased by 62% <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Now on the Avito website there are about 14,000 advertisements for the sale of mining equipment, and during January their number reached 23,000. The same number of ads were submitted for the entire 3rd quarter of 2017. <br><br>  In a press release Avito reported that the demand for equipment for the extraction of cryptocurrency is small.  In January, out of 23,000 ads, the deals went through a total of 1525, that is, 6.6% of the ads.  If you compare with similar statistics for the past months, the demand fell by 34%. <br><br>  The average price of a small farm in ads for sale is from 170 thousand to 175 thousand rubles.  The average price of real transactions in January is 126 thousand rubles.  At the Yula alternative trading floor, the number of deals also fell in January, and the average price was 214 thousand rubles. <br><br>  Experienced miners say that with a low bitcoin rate, the payback period of the farm stretches to 10 months, and before buying on the secondary market, it is necessary to test the equipment. <br><br>  After reaching the bottom of February 6, the bitcoin rate began to grow moderately, and with it the rest of the cryptocurrencies.  Perhaps, in the event of a new sharp jump, the rush demand for video cards will resume.  If not, then the market situation should soon return to normal - and the cost of video cards, perhaps, will return to normal values. </div>
