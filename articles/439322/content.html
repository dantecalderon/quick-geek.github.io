<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As you know, smartphones and other mobile devices in Russia will soon begin to <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/437692/">pre</a> - <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/437692/">compile Russian programs</a> without fail.  In the future, import substitution will go further, until the transition to the Russian operating system. <br><br>  Today, the status of "Russian" has only one mobile operating system - OS Sailfsish, which is now owned by the corporation "Rostelecom".  Today, the owners <a href="https://www.company.rt.ru/press/news/d447516/">announced</a> that “the only domestic mobile operating system” has received a new Russian-language name - “Aurora”. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According <a href="https://t.me/zatelecom/8480">to one of the developers</a> , this business in Russia was launched by “widely known in narrow circles” businessman <a href="http://www.tadviser.ru/index.php/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0:%25D0%25AD%25D0%25B9%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581_%25D0%259F%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB_%25D0%2595%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%258C%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587">Pavel Eyges</a> based on the Finnish open source project.  The idea was to get a state order for the supply of vehicles to state institutions and security forces.  However, in the end, the businessman sold the project to the corporation Rostelecom, so that now it will implement the plan. <br><br>  The OS Aurora is developed by Open Mobile Platform LLC and Votron LLC, which since 2018 are included in the Rostelecom group. <br><br>  Rostelecom President Mikhail Oseevsky said: <br><blockquote>  Of course, the domestic mobile operating system should have a name in Russian, which is easily remembered, full of energy and positive.  Aurora has great prospects ahead, it should become a reliable digital assistant of the state and business in solving their tasks, ensuring the remote involvement of officials and employees in work processes.  I would especially like to emphasize that the domestic OS already has two dozen partners who integrate their developments into it.  We are open to cooperation with Russian software and mobile application developers, only together we will be able to make the operating system truly useful and convenient. </blockquote>  Aurora supports all standard mobile OS functions: contact management, calls and messages, email client, browser, media viewing, calendar, notes, camera and gallery, clocks and timers, voice recorder, work with documents, etc. Available or in progress testing navigation system, solutions for fast processing and image recognition, a service for remote meetings and others. <br><br>  Currently, projects with 10 departments and companies are at the stage of preparation and testing of equipment with the Aurora operating system preinstalled, Rostelecom reports. <br><br>  It is especially emphasized that the mobile OS was included in the unified register of Russian software on September 5, 2016 (under No. 1543), has the certificate of conformity of the Federal Security Service of Russia AK1 / KC1.  Such certificates are missing from Android and iOS. <br><br>  The FSTEC of Russia issued to the domestic OS a certificate of compliance with information security requirements for sixth grade type A operating systems. <br><br><blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jy/sd/rr/jysdrr7tqgfjt50wtcshw89ctho.png" align="left"><h3>  Minute of care from UFO </h3><br>  This material could cause contradictory feelings, so before writing a comment, refresh something important in your memory: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How to write a comment and survive</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  Do not write abusive comments, do not go to the person. </li><li>  Refrain from using obscene language and toxic behavior (even in a veiled form). </li><li>  To report comments that violate the rules of the site, use the "Report" button (if available) or <a href="https://habr.com/feedback/%3Ftype%3D4">a feedback form</a> . </li></ul><br>  What to do if: <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/karma/">minus karma</a> |  <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/sandbox/">blocked account</a> <br><br>  → <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/other/">Code of authors Habra</a> and <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/other/">habraetiket</a> <br>  → <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/rules/">Full site rules</a> </div></div></blockquote></div>
