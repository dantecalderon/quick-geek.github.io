Here are some possible reasons. <br><br><ul><li>  The name is outdated in the modern world. </li><li>  Multiple products combined under one umbrella brand. </li><li>  The company, along with the products absorbed by another company </li><li>  The name began to cause bad associations. </li></ul><br>  In general, a new name can give impetus, attract attention, correctly position the product on the market.  To come up with a new name is only a small part, about 1% of all tasks.  It is necessary to do a large amount of technical work that does not introduce new scenarios, or solves the problem of the customer.  To calculate the return on investment for these "non-functional" costs is impossible.  This is the pain of a product manager. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I will not add water to the text, but limit myself to a list that can be used as a checklist.  These actions are typical for software products.  In physical goods has its own characteristics. <br><br>  So where to make changes. <br><br>  <b>Interface.</b>  Logos, text information. <br><br>  <b>Name in the installer</b> .  If the product is a cloud service, then it can also have an installable part, for example, browser extensions. <br><br>  Product <b>metadata</b> in library file properties, folder names. <br><br>  <b>The name in the stores</b> , if it is distributed through the Appstore, Google Play, Microsoft Store and others. <br><br>  End User License Agreement may contain a product name. <br><br>  <b>Background information</b> , whitepapers, documentation, title on the support forum. <br><br>  <b>Entries in the price list</b> , for example, in Salesforce.  Usually, renaming does not change the number in the directory (model number / SKU / part number), but it can be.  So you will need to make and new numbers. <br><br>  <b>Marketing and technical materials</b> , including, but not limited to, slides, pages of sites. <br><br>  All this, in an amicable way, must also be tested in order not to accidentally forget the old name. <br><br>  If you work with partners, you should notify them in advance.  Because they will also have to follow the steps from the list above.  In the case when they only sell or implement, then the amount of work is less.  If they make a decision on your product, then most likely they will need to go this way completely. <br><br>  A simple example, you make the Awesome client for Axapta solution for Microsoft Axapta, after renaming the platform in Dynamics AX and the name of your product should be changed to Awesome client for Dynamics AX. <br><br>  As you can see, renaming is a big project.  At each stage, pitfalls may appear, in the form of a non-post text, or a legal prohibition on using the old name, so it has to be cleaned very quickly.  And most importantly, it requires the involvement of resources from both the developers and the QA team. <br><br>  And it would seem that a new name was chosen and agreed, but its replacement may not fit in one release. <br><br>  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/uxguide/exper-branding">In addition, interesting recommendations from Microsoft</a> </div>
