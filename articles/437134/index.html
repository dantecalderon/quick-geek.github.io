Our experts analyzed the methods of cybercriminals using <a href="https://crystalblockchain.com/">Bitfury Crystal</a> , a tool for tracking cryptocurrency in public blockchains.</i>  <i>The principles of its operation are based on the clustering algorithm (which we mentioned in the previous subsection) and a special tracking algorithm.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>We describe how the Bitfury team monitored the movement of stolen Bitcoins to output points - the Binance, Livecoin and BTCBox.com exchanges.</i>  <i>We give a step by step algorithm of actions.</i> <br><br><hr><br><h5>  <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelwolfson/2018/11/26/tracing-illegal-activity-through-the-bitcoin-blockchain-to-combat-cryptocurrency-related-crimes/">How to track an attacker using a bitcoin blockchain</a> </h5><br>  <i>The Forbes article on cryptogy giant plans (including Bitfury) on the development of tools to protect blockchains and cryptographs, which were discussed at the main industry event -
