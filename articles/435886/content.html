The reduction was announced in an email to employees from President Gwynn Shotwell, which <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-spacex-layoffs-20190111-story.html">was made available to the</a> <i>LA Times</i> .  “This is a very difficult, but necessary decision,” it says. <br><br>  "To continue customer service and succeed in the development of interplanetary spacecraft and the global space Internet, SpaceX should become a more compact company," the statement said.  - Any of these events, even when they were undertaken separately, bankrupted other organizations.  This means that we have to part with some talented and hardworking members of our team. ” <br><br>  <i><font color="gray">In the illustration: on January 11, Ilon Musk published the <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1083567087983964160">first photo of a</a> prototype of a heavy carrier rocket Starship (BFR)</font></i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Even with the increase in the number of launches of SpaceX satellites - 21 launches in 2018, compared with 18 launches a year earlier, it sometimes reduced staff.  Last summer, the company sacked several senior managers in Redmond, Wash., Due to disagreements over the pace of development and testing of its Starlink satellite program.

Musk said that in early February, SpaceX will conduct the first hopper test of a prototype Martian spacecraft.  The production of this ship and the rocket will cost him billions of dollars. <br><br>  The body of the Starship rocket is made of stainless steel - high-strength, but very heavy material.  According to Mask, stainless steel is more resistant to extreme temperatures, which makes it more suitable for missiles of this type.  This prototype Starship is designed for test suborbital flights that will begin in March, and the orbital version will be higher, with a thicker shell and a more smoothly curved nose fairing.  Its launch is scheduled for 2020. <br><br>  Starship is the new name of the BFR (Big Falcon Rocket) launch system.  It consists of a spacecraft and a rocket booster.  The system will be able to put into orbit up to 100 tons of payload, it also implies repeated use.  According to the mask, the Starship will eventually replace the Falcon 9 and will be able to serve all missions in the orbits of Earth, the Moon and Mars. <br><br>  SpaceX recently announced an additional investment of about $ 273 million.  The total value of the company is about $ 31 billion, according to Equidate, which tracks the assessments of private companies. <br><br>  In May 2018, in an interview with Shotwell, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/05/22/cnbc-speaks-to-spacex-president-gwynne-shotwell.html">she told CNBC</a> that the company was profitable and had a margin of profit "for many years." <br><br>  According to the mailing list from the executive director, SpaceX offers to dismissed employees a retirement benefit of at least eight weeks and other benefits.  The company will also assist in finding new jobs, advice and recommendations for resumes. </div>
