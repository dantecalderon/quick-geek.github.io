True, they will be enacted only after the adoption of the law itself.  As for the checks, they were previously mentioned by experts, who believe that only testing the work of the Russian network segment in the field can help identify real threats to Runet. <br><br>  “Pilots will be 100%, and we will do them together with telecom operators, but after the adoption of the law,” <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/15/02/2019/5c666af39a79478787a38cd3">said</a> Alexander Zharov.  It is worth recalling that the bill on measures for the protection and sustainable operation of the Internet in Russia <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/440006/">was adopted</a> in the first reading in the State Duma on Tuesday, February 12. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At the same time, State Duma Chairman Vyacheslav Volodin called for the draft law to be finalized for the following readings.  He said that the task of the law is “not to close, not to cut off, but to ensure the safety of the Internet.” <br><br>  The bill involves the creation of a national system for obtaining information on domain names or network addresses.  It is designed to define traffic routing rules.  The objective of the rules is to minimize the transfer abroad of data exchanged between Russian users.  Providers will have to install specialized equipment that will help determine the source of the transmitted traffic. <br><br>  The bill was supported by the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media, Roskomnadzor, the Federal Service for Technical and Export Control, Rossvyaz and FSO.  In addition, it is also supported by the government, subject to further refinement of the document. <br><br>  The Chamber of Accounts, after submitting the bill to the State Duma for consideration, considered that the implementation of the law would inevitably lead to an increase in the cost of goods and services with a simultaneous increase in budget expenditures for these purposes. <br><br>  Yesterday, <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/440408/">it was</a> also <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/440408/">reported</a> that providers that do not receive specialized equipment from the state will be exempt from liability for failure to comply with the law (which has not yet been adopted). <br><br><blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jy/sd/rr/jysdrr7tqgfjt50wtcshw89ctho.png" align="left"><h3>  Minute of care from UFO </h3><br>  This material could cause contradictory feelings, so before writing a comment, refresh something important in your memory: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How to write a comment and survive</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  Do not write abusive comments, do not go to the person. </li><li>  Refrain from using obscene language and toxic behavior (even in a veiled form). </li><li>  To report comments that violate the rules of the site, use the "Report" button (if available) or <a href="https://habr.com/feedback/%3Ftype%3D4">a feedback form</a> . </li></ul><br>  What to do if: <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/karma/">minus karma</a> |  <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/sandbox/">blocked account</a> <br><br>  → <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/other/">Code of authors Habra</a> and <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/other/">habraetiket</a> <br>  → <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/rules/">Full site rules</a> </div></div></blockquote></div>
