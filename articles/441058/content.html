<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, Habr! <br><br>  My name is Misha, and I am a student.  At the optional theory of games, we solve various interesting problems, and I would like to share with you one of these. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Game Description</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  "I love Warhammer, so I decided to adapt the condition" <br><blockquote>  1. Two are playing. <br><br>  2. The game field is a 3 by 3 board. <br><br>  3. Each player has an army of 100 space marines. <br><br>  4. Before the battle at night, each side secretly places its units in an arbitrary way on 9 squares.  On each cell, you can put any integer number of Space Marines from 0 to 100. <br><br>  5. The battle for the next planet begins in the morning.  On each of the 9 cells, the player who has more Astartes on this cell wins.  For winning on each of the 9 cells is given 1 point.  If the same number is on a certain cell, then the battle on this cell ends in a draw, and both players get 0.5 points. <br><br>  6. The battle is won by the one who won more fields.  If both players have won 4.5 fields, the battle ends in a draw. </blockquote></div></div><br>  I came up with my strategy, but I had an idea how to make this contest more interesting, as well as conduct research.  I have prepared a <a href="https://game.pavlukhinlab.com/">competition</a> for everyone, where you can compete with other people in this task. <br><br>  At the moment, while sending, your decision will play 10 games with random people, and also with some probability it will play with new strategies, and on Friday recalculation will be made for all decisions and the final leaderboard will be posted. <br><br>  And that's not all - at the moment every 2 minutes, 2 neurons play 10,000 games with each other, and, of course, I wonder who will be better: neuron or humanity <br><br>  By the weekend I will prepare an article about the results of my research. <br><br>  Game Link: <a href="https://game.pavlukhinlab.com/">game.pavlukhinlab.com</a> <br><br>  <i>upd: I do not intend to store personal data (e-mail).</i>  <i>Delete them after getting the results</i> </div>
