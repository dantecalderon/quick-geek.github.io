Therefore, the developers simply transferred from one project to another - and made a rebranding.  Like Amigo, the new Atom browser is based on Chromium. <br><br>  Atom can be downloaded from the <a href="https://browser.ru/">browser.ru</a> website.  Today began open beta testing. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The main features of Atom developers consider speed, security and privacy: <br><br><blockquote>  Atom will not only warn you about unsafe sites, prevent phishing threats and installing malware, but also tell you how to manage your security settings.  You will always know what happens when you activate different functions.  Also in Atom, you can manage security settings for all sites at once, and for each individual site. </blockquote><br>  Probably, Mail.ru took into account the mistakes of the past, because Amigo dealt a serious blow to its reputation: <br><br><blockquote>  When promoting the browser "Amigo" a number of wrong steps were taken.  Thus, partners and advertising networks were involved in promotion, some of which turned out to be dishonest - they used gray schemes to distribute the browser, which contradicted the rules specified in the agreement.  Such actions caused a negative attitude to the product.  In this connection, Mail.Ru Group decided to abandon the further development of the Amigo brand. <br><br>  At the same time, Mail.Ru Group considers the market niche of browsers to be promising and does not exclude the possibility that work in this direction will continue.  With the development of new products, the promotion format will be fundamentally changed based on the experience gained by the company.  - <i>from the <a href="https://hitech.vesti.ru/article/896391/">press release</a> on the termination of the project "Amigo"</i> </blockquote><br>  Previously, "Amigo" imperceptibly installed in conjunction with extraneous programs, and then I registered myself in autoload and Windows Task Scheduler.  Let's see how it will be now.  “From the point of view of the product, Amigo was a good browser, <a href="https://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2019/02/05/793290-mailru-atom">” a</a> representative of Mail.ru <a href="https://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2019/02/05/793290-mailru-atom">said</a> .  - The main reason for his failure was aggressive marketing.  Therefore, in the new product, we plan to use more “clean” methods of promotion and open interaction with users. ” <br><br><blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jy/sd/rr/jysdrr7tqgfjt50wtcshw89ctho.png" align="left"><h3>  Minute of care from UFO </h3><br>  This material could cause contradictory feelings, so before writing a comment, refresh something important in your memory: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How to write a comment and survive</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  Do not write abusive comments, do not go to the person. </li><li>  Refrain from using obscene language and toxic behavior (even in a veiled form). </li><li>  To report comments that violate the rules of the site, use the "Report" button (if available) or <a href="https://habr.com/feedback/%3Ftype%3D4">a feedback form</a> . </li></ul><br>  What to do if: <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/karma/">minus karma</a> |  <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/sandbox/">blocked account</a> <br><br>  → <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/other/">Code of authors Habra</a> and <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/other/">habraetiket</a> <br>  → <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/rules/">Full site rules</a> </div></div></blockquote></div>
