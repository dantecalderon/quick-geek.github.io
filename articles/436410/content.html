<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The Federal Antimonopoly Service of the Russian Federation has published an analytical report, in which Microsoft called the position of Microsoft on the Russian market of operating systems, the Vedomosti report. <br><br>  According to the FAS for 2015, the following situation has developed on desktops and laptops: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Windows - 95.6%</b> </li><li>  macOS - 2.5% </li><li>  Linux - 1.9% </li></ul><br>  It may be noted a significant increase in the coverage of Linux.  There were times when a free OS could barely manage to overcome the 1% barrier on desktops.  However, it’s far from Windows. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  FAS conducted an analysis of the market for operating systems when it considered a complaint from Kaspersky Lab about the infringement of third-party antivirus rights in Windows 10. The case against Microsoft was <a href="https://fas.gov.ru/news/25455">one of the best in the history of FAS</a> . <br><br>  Kaspersky Lab complained that in 2015, the Windows manufacturer, before launching the Windows 10 operating system, did not give the anti-virus software developers enough time to ensure that their anti-virus applications are compatible with the new operating system.  The terms of providing RTM – versions for them were reduced from two months to six days. <br><br>  FAS acknowledged the unfair competition, including: <br><br><ul><li>  creation of special conditions for Windows Defender; </li><li>  posting on the official website and on Youtube a video where Microsoft representatives urge to abandon third-party anti-virus software in favor of Windows Defender. </li></ul><br>  On June 13, 2017, the FAS issued two cessation warnings, and Microsoft reported on the implementation of the warnings in a timely manner: <br><br><ul><li>  made changes to the "Requirements for anti-virus software" ("Antimalware Platform Requirements"); </li><li>  increased the period for providing RTM-versions of Windows 10 to independent anti-virus software vendors; </li><li>  removed the footage. </li></ul><br>  Despite the fulfillment of the requirements, Microsoft came to the attention of the FAS, as a result of which they are now officially recognized as a monopolist.  It is curious how in this case the FAS will apply the antitrust laws. </div>
