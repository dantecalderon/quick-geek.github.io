<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Previously, the trees were taller, the grass is greener, and Java was free.  What now?  I don’t know about biology, but let's deal with Java ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The article was prepared specifically for the OTUS blog and was dedicated to the launch of the next <a href="https://otus.ru/lessons/razrabotchik-java">Java Developer</a> course. <br><br>  Probably, many have already seen that the latest release of Oracle Java is a bit unusual. <br>  On <a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html">the distribution page</a> there is the following text: <br><blockquote>  Important changes in Oracle JDK 11 License <br>  With JDK 11, the Oracle JDK has been updated. <br></blockquote>  Changed the license to use Java.  We follow the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/terms/license/javase-license.html">link</a> and read: <br><blockquote>  This is a non-negotiable, non-transferable, limited liability program. </blockquote>  Those.  Oracle has now clearly defined for what purposes Java 11 can be used, these are: <br><br><ul><li>  developing </li><li>  testing </li><li>  prototyping (prototyping) </li><li>  and demonstrating (and demonstration). </li></ul><br>  Anything more there is nothing.  This is a closed clear list. <br><br>  And where is the commercial use for profit? <br><br>  And he is no more.  If you go to use java 11 for commercial purposes - buy a subscription. <br><br>  It turns out that free Java has become unexpectedly paid. <br><br>  You will say that this is not a big problem, because  in nature there is <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/">OpenJDK</a> and it will save us. <br><br>  OpenJDK really is and it will really save us.  But there is one small blockhead - OpenJDK - this is just a set of text files that still need to be compiled binaries for our Java application to work in production.  And there is some difficulty - to assemble a runtime ready for battle from the OpenJDK files is not the easiest thing. <br><br>  Here on the scene there are organizations that will make this important matter.  But as it turns out, their products are either of poor quality or expensive.  And we need free and high quality. <br><br>  What to do? <br><br>  In St. Petersburg, Oracle had a development center where Java was developed and tuned.  We know many of these competent engineers from numerous and very useful reports on Jpoint, Joker, etc. <br><br>  Oracle closed the center, the engineers dispersed.  Some of them organized the software company <a href="https://bell-sw.com/pages/home">Bellsoft</a> .  BellSoft also builds and tests a build of JDK based on OpenJDK ( <a href="">Liberica JDK</a> ).  They have a paid subscription, and there is an opportunity for free, i.e.  for free to use a binary build, i.e.  the fact that we used to download from the Oracle site. <br><br>  Free is good, but what about quality? <br><br>  First, they are engaged in this work, not by random people, but by experienced Oracle JDK developers, who know from the inside how it all works. <br><br>  Secondly, BellSoft is a <a href="https://bell-sw.com/public/announcements/2019/02/13/JetBrains-BellSoft-Liberica-OpenJDK/">technology partner of</a> another well-known company JetBrains.  BellSoft supports JetBrains Runtime, the platform on which IntelliJ products run. <br><br>  Obviously, we have enough reason to try Liberica JDK in action and save significant budgets. <br><br>  PS: By the way, on February 14 in Krok, BellSoft representatives told about Liberica JDK.  The organizers promised to post materials <a href="https://vk.com/jugmsk">here</a> , waiting :) <br><br>  UPD. <br>  The idea of ​​a post in one line: <br>  The Java Platform (JDK), which was downloaded from the Oracle site, can no longer be used for commercial purposes. <br>  There are alternatives, one of them is Liberica JDK. </div>
