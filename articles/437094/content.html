I try to help our teams use Atlassian tools as efficiently as possible.  I study and use Python to automate processes. <br>  The report will talk about how we ran the Atlassian Service Desk for internal projects.  For the year of gradual implementation, we faced a variety of problems: from setting up chains of approvals to the loss of incoming mail calls.  I'll tell you how we coped with all this and how we automated a large part of the requests.  We will talk a little about how to notify users, how to work with deferred requests, about the user profile and whether it is possible to do something useful with it. </blockquote><p><br clear="left"></p><br><h3 id="otchyoty-atlassian-service-desk-olga-nikolaeva-toolstrek">  Atlassian Service Desk Reports, Olga Nikolaeva, Toolstrek </h3><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/90/8x/ym/908xymuhpl2tvejobokurnnlkw0.png" alt="image" align="left"><br>  Olga began working with Atlassian in 2007, in Yandex.
