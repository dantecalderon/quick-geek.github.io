<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  A group of researchers from Stanford and the University of New York has released a <a href="https://nyti.ms/2HHQCAb">new study</a> on the impact of facebook on our mood, attention and relationships. </p><br><p>  The peculiarity is that it is the most impressive and deep research (n = 3000, check-ins every day for a month, etc.) about the influence of social media on people today.  The control group used FB daily, while the experimental group abandoned it for a month. </p><br><p>  <strong>results</strong> <a name="habracut"></a>  : Rejection of Facebook causes difficulties in relations with relatives, creates problems with time planning, and complicates articulation of political views. </p><br><p>  Just kidding  Of course, people without Facebook have more time (≈1 hour per day), they pay more attention to friends and family, they have less radical political views. </p><br><p>  In the process, it turned out that people, on average, estimate the refusal of FB for a month at $ 100–200 (remember, this is what they want for +30 hours to life). </p><br><p>  Perhaps the most important discovery: turning off social media just enhances the mood and the feeling of pleasure from life.  Not much, but statistically significant. </p><br><p>  Stanford researchers have not yet made official conclusions, and are waiting for peer studies.  However, it is clear that FB as a platform is increasingly being pressed to do something with the so-called "attention hygiene". </p></div>
