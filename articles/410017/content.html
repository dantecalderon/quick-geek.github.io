<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ql/99/5r/ql995rhyone8wczoyy4fyc0dt4c.jpeg"><br><br>  The United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) has launched a new charity project <a href="https://www.chaingers.io/en/index.html">called Game Chaingers</a> to help starving Syrian children.  In Syria, civil war has been under way for seven years, and about nine million children risk being left without emergency help due to lack of livelihood. <br><br>  Charity event is unusual.  The fact is that the call of UNICEF is not addressed to anyone, but specifically to gamers.  They are asked to download the client and start mining the Etherium cryptocurrency in favor of the Syrian children. <br><br>  Gamers were chosen as the target audience not only because they have a valuable means of extracting money - video cards, but also because UNICEF considers them the most active part of society.  And professional gamers and streamers with thousands of subscribers have great authority and influence on the audience. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In addition, the use of mining and cryptocurrency for UNICEF is a way to reach a fundamentally new audience instead of seeking donations through the old channels to the same people.  Many of the miners and gamers, perhaps, have never taken part in charity events in their lives - and now they can do it with the help of their GPUs. <br><br>  At the moment, 572 participants of the action are registered, who donated or downloaded the client.  There are 60 active clients in the pool, and the computational power is 1964.61 megahesha / s.  For a couple of days, miners minted ether in the amount of 1,722.64 euros. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ag/ym/y2/agymy2f_us_308zmghl82s_szfu.png"><br><br>  From the official site there is a client for mining, there are versions for Windows and Linux, Nvidia and AMD graphics processors.  The client uses the standard Claymore's Dual ETH + DCR / SC / LBC / PASC GPU Miner version 10.6.  Primary Pool Address: eu1.ethermine.org:4444. <br><br>  This “dual” mining client is capable of simultaneously mining ether and Decred / Siacoin / Lbry / Pascal, but the second pool is not involved in the client from UNICEF.  The generated coins are immediately listed on the United Nations wallet.  You can not even mine, but make a simple donation by sending a broadcast to the ETH-wallet 0x29165d4a5eE555b3B47FA7d4772f35FE41dB2769. <br><br>  The UNICEF project is the first of its kind.  Although <a href="http://time.com/money/5048745/there-could-be-as-many-as-200-bitcoin-billionaires-in-the-world-right-now/">200 new billionaires</a> appeared in the world due to the growth of cryptocurrencies in the world, some unexpectedly rich geeks <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/296545/">donate</a> tens of millions of dollars from the money that fell on them, but never before have charity projects offered to donate money through mining. <br><br>  UNICEF is the official structure of the United Nations.  Obviously, the fact of accepting donations through mining will be reflected in its financial statements.  As in the case of other charitable organizations that accept cryptocurrency, this means that digital money is recognized as the official form of payment. <br><br>  Earlier, an anonymous bitcoin millionaire founded the <a href="https://pineapplefund.org/">Pineapple Fund</a> charity foundation — and began sending out large amounts of bitcoins to organizations that deserve support.  Usually each of them gets a million dollars, although some may get more, while others less.  Anonymous has already distributed Bitcoins to $ 44.5 million. Donations have received various organizations: from those involved in psychedelic clinical trials to help people with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), to free software projects (Apache, Free Software Foundation) and <a href="https://human-i-t.org/">collecting donations in the form of computer components</a> . <br><br>  UNICEF promotion will last until March 31, 2018.  It must be said that this is not the first time that the UN uses modern technology for charitable purposes.  In May 2017, the WFP (United Nations World Food Program) <a href="https://www.wfp.org/news/news-release/blockchain-against-hunger-harnessing-technology-support-syrian-refugees">launched a chain of Etherium blocks</a> to distribute food to 10,000 Syrian refugees.  The biometric data of starving Syrians was recorded in a computer system with blockchain support, and they themselves had the opportunity to buy products, showing the iris at the checkout counter. </div>
