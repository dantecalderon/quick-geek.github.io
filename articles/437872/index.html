  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Shoemaker without shoes. How students wrote phishing emails</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  Hi, Habr!  I am the editor of this blog, and sometimes I also teach virology at the university. </p><br><p>  I decided to diversify the learning process and came up with several tasks for fifth-year students - such that practice and relevance, and not write off the code from 2003.  One of the tasks is to create and send phishing emails to fictional people who could exist in reality.  After all, if you don‚Äôt know how to attack, you won‚Äôt know how to defend, right? </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6y/jv/pk/6yjvpkw-obxhkdgwdup2dpdhyze.png"></p><br><p>  I will show the best of what happened: what letters scammers could send on behalf of Yandex.Money, how students pretended to be services, and for dessert - techniques that scammers use right now (for example, several letters received by our vigilant users). </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2 id="preduprezhdenie">  A warning </h2><br><p>  <em>Do not engage in phishing.</em>  <em>Formally, this is a fraud, it is prosecuted under article 159.6 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.</em>  <em>Laboratory work was carried out under controlled conditions, the letters were sent to pre-prepared boxes, access to which is available only from the author of the post.</em>  <em>Students are warned about possible liability for phishing mailing outside the lab.</em> </p><br><p>  <em>All characters are fictional, all coincidences with real people and organizations are random.</em>  <em>All logos, trademarks and names belong to their respective owners.</em> </p><br><p>  I already told a similar story just over a year ago.  Since then, I have become the editor of Habrablog.  I work a lot with various departments, including the department of information security.  The whole company, which is logical, is about money, and security is appropriately appropriate here - the security service (SB) protects everything and everyone inside, and also stops the attempts of fraudsters to outrage on behalf of the service. </p><br><p>  And since I decided to give the students such a task, I wondered if they could relatively honestly take away fictional money from fictional characters.  Here, motivation is important - all this is done only for educational purposes, so that future security experts understand what threats are and how to protect themselves from them. </p><br><h1 id="dramaturgiya">  Dramaturgy </h1><br><p>  All people are different - with different experiences, knowledge in IT and different beliefs in people - so I came up with three characters and asked the students to find an approach to them.  The restrictions were purely technical - the letter should be sent to the specified box, it should not get into spam, and there should be a way to collect personal data.  Which ones - at the discretion of the student. </p><br><p>  The full laboratory assignment is under the spoiler. </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Job on the lab</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><pre><code class="plaintext hljs">–ù—É–∂–Ω–æ –æ—Ç–ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏—Ç—å —Ç—Ä–∏ –ø–∏—Å—å–º–∞ —Ç—Ä—ë–º –≤—ã–¥—É–º–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–º –ø–µ—Ä—Å–æ–Ω–∞–∂–∞–º. –£—Å–ª–æ–≤–∏—è 1. –ü–∏—Å—å–º–∞ –Ω—É–∂–Ω–æ –¥–µ–π—Å—Ç–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ –æ—Ç–ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏—Ç—å –Ω–∞ —É–∫–∞–∑–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –ø–æ—á—Ç–æ–≤—ã–µ —è—â–∏–∫–∏. –ß–µ—Ä–µ–∑ napechata.li/form –Ω—É–∂–Ω–æ –≤—ã—Å–ª–∞—Ç—å —Å–ø–∏—Å–æ–∫ –∞–¥—Ä–µ—Å–æ–≤, —Å –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã—Ö —É—à–ª–∏ –ø–∏—Å—å–º–∞. 2. –°—á–∏—Ç–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è, —á—Ç–æ –ø–µ—Ä—Å–æ–Ω–∞–∂–∏ –æ—Ç–∫—Ä—ã–≤–∞—é—Ç –ø–∏—Å—å–º–∞ –Ω–∞ —Ä–∞–±–æ—á–∏—Ö –∫–æ–º–ø—å—é—Ç–µ—Ä–∞—Ö –≤ —Ä–∞–±–æ—á–µ–µ –≤—Ä–µ–º—è. 3. –ü—Ä–∏ –Ω–∞–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏–∏ –Ω—É–∂–Ω–æ –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å –∏–Ω–¥–∏–≤–∏–¥—É–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ –æ—Å–æ–±–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –ø–µ—Ä—Å–æ–Ω–∞–∂–µ–π, —É–∫–∞–∑–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –≤ –∑–∞–¥–∞–Ω–∏–∏. –ü–æ —É–º–æ–ª—á–∞–Ω–∏—é —Å—á–∏—Ç–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è, —á—Ç–æ –ø–∏—Å—å–º–æ, –Ω–∞–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –∫–æ–º—É —É–≥–æ–¥–Ω–æ –∏ –±–µ–∑ –¥–µ—Ç–∞–ª–µ–π, –Ω–µ –∏–¥–µ—Ç –≤ –∑–∞—á–µ—Ç. 4. –¶–µ–ª—å –∞—Ç–∞–∫–∏ ‚Äî –¥–æ—Å—Ç—É–ø –≤–æ –≤–Ω—É—Ç—Ä–µ–Ω–Ω—é—é —Å–µ—Ç—å –∏–ª–∏ –∫ –¥–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–º (–ø–æ—á—Ç–∞, –∫–∞–ª–µ–Ω–¥–∞—Ä–∏, –∞—Ä—Ö–∏–≤—ã, —Ñ–∏–Ω–∞–Ω—Å–æ–≤–∞—è –∏–Ω—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∞—Ü–∏—è) –æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏–∏, –≤ –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–π —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞–µ—Ç –∫–∞–∂–¥—ã–π –∏–∑ –ø–µ—Ä—Å–æ–Ω–∞–∂–µ–π. –ú–µ–Ω—å—à–∏–π –ø—Ä–∏–æ—Ä–∏—Ç–µ—Ç –≤ –ø–æ–ª—É—á–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –ª–∏—á–Ω—ã—Ö –¥–∞–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –ø–µ—Ä—Å–æ–Ω–∞–∂–µ–π. 5. –û—Ç –∫–æ–≥–æ, –ø–æ–¥ –∫–∞–∫–∏–º –ø—Ä–µ–¥–ª–æ–≥–æ–º –∏ –∫–∞–∫ –±—É–¥–µ—Ç —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ä—à–∞—Ç—å—Å—è –∞—Ç–∞–∫–∞, –æ—Å—Ç–∞—ë—Ç—Å—è –Ω–∞ –≤–∞—à–µ —É—Å–º–æ—Ç—Ä–µ–Ω–∏–µ. –ò—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ –¥–æ–ø. —Å—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–≤ (—Å–∫—Ä–∏–ø—Ç—ã, –¥–æ–∫—É–º–µ–Ω—Ç—ã —Å –º–∞–∫—Ä–æ—Å–∞–º–∏, —Å–æ—Ñ—Ç) –∏–¥–µ—Ç –≤ –∑–∞—á–µ—Ç –ø—Ä–∏ –Ω–∞–ª–∏—á–∏–∏ –ø–æ–¥—Ö–æ–¥—è—â–µ–π –ª–µ–≥–µ–Ω–¥—ã. 6. –ü–∏—Å—å–º–∞, –ø–æ–ø–∞–≤—à–∏–µ –≤ —Å–ø–∞–º, –Ω–µ –∏–¥—É—Ç –≤ –∑–∞—á—ë—Ç. 7. –ü–∏—Å—å–º–æ, —Å—Å—ã–ª–∫–∞ –≤ –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–º –Ω–∏–∫—É–¥–∞ –Ω–µ –≤–µ–¥—ë—Ç, –Ω–µ –∏–¥—ë—Ç –≤ –∑–∞—á—ë—Ç. –í –æ—Ç—á–µ—Ç–µ –¥–æ–ª–∂–Ω—ã –±—ã—Ç—å: 1. –¢–µ–∫—Å—Ç—ã –∏–ª–∏ —Å–∫—Ä–∏–Ω—à–æ—Ç—ã –ø–∏—Å–µ–º 2. –û–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏–µ —Ç–æ–≥–æ, –ø–æ—á–µ–º—É –∫–∞–∂–¥–æ–º—É –∏–∑ –ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª–µ–π –±—ã–ª–æ –æ—Ç–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–æ –ø–∏—Å—å–º–æ 3. –ö–∞–∫—É—é –∏–Ω—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∞—Ü–∏—é –ø–ª–∞–Ω–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–ª–æ—Å—å –ø–æ–ª—É—á–∏—Ç—å –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ –æ—Ç–ø—Ä–∞–≤–∫–∏ –ø–∏—Å–µ–º 4. –ö–∞–∫—É—é –∏–Ω—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∞—Ü–∏—é —É–¥–∞–ª–æ—Å—å –ø–æ–ª—É—á–∏—Ç—å –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ –æ—Ç–ø—Ä–∞–≤–∫–∏ –ø–∏—Å–µ–º 5. –°–ø–∏—Å–æ–∫ –∞–¥—Ä–µ—Å–æ–≤, —Å –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã—Ö –æ—Ç–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∞ –ø–æ—á—Ç–∞</code> </pre> </div></div><br><p>  <strong>Valeria Valerievna Golova, 31 years old, Ust-Kamenogorsk</strong> </p><br><p>  Lawyer in the private law firm "Soft Sign".

However, most of them reflect the real phishing patterns that students found on the Internet and tried to apply the tasks to the condition. </p><br><h2 id="albert-alberlive">  Albert Alberlive </h2><br><p>  Honestly, this character intrigued me most of all - what will happen, what letters and from which services will fly?  Financial pyramids, e-wallets, cryptocurrencies?  Students did not disappoint - in the "Inbox" were letters on all these topics and from the majority of popular payment systems.  I want to show every single one, but, unfortunately, this is impossible. </p><br><h3 id="fishing-ot-imeni-yandeksdeneg">  Phishing on behalf of Yandex.Money </h3><br><p>  First of all, I was interested in letters on behalf of Yandex. Money. </p><br><p>  All students who sent letters on behalf of the service applied a similar approach - to announce a new product that will save them from all problems and help them earn.  As I will show later, this is not entirely consistent with the real behavior of the scammers. </p><br><p>  Let me remind you that all the official Yandex.Money applications live <a href="https://yandex.ru/promo/money/apps">in a special section on the Yandex website</a> , and the announcements of new pieces are <a href="https://money.yandex.ru/page%3Fid%3D524407">in the press office</a> .  Check there if you suddenly see an unusual or shocking announcement about Yandex.Money in an incomprehensible source. </p><br><p>  And now let's see what is wrong with these letters.  Especially for this, I caught in the corridor Natasha, the lead editor of Money, and showed screenshots.  Natasha knows everything about how they write and do not write in Money, which I used. </p><br><p>  The question was simple: how to understand that it was not written by us?  I pass the microphone: </p><br><h3 id="yandekskriptokoshelyok">  Yandex.Kriptokrelok </h3><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u1/dm/yk/u1dmykyygxnj_c17wveuzrmmljm.png"></p><br><p>  Top-level: it is not clear why the user generally receives a letter on this topic;  a letter about what cryptocurrencies are generally good at, but how they can be useful to me is unclear. </p><br><p>  According to the text: exclamation marks (we have almost none), clerical on the clerk (ensuring the security of transactions -) + negligence with typography. </p><br><h3 id="yandeksspasatel">  Yandex.Master </h3><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_p/ni/z0/_pniz0rmo6cnf2pbbsfv62pwd60.png"><br>  - Name + mail in circulation. </p><br><p>  - Uncertainty: what does "compromised" mean?  Well, where am I? </p><br><p>  - Again clerical. </p><br><p>  - What is ‚Äúconfirmed recovery‚Äù, I would like to know. </p><br><p>  - No link header + button (we usually try to ensure that this combination gives a general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe essence). </p><br><h3 id="tehpodderzhka-yandeksdeneg">  Yandex.Money technical support </h3><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ni/gf/_7/nigf_748fdk8teo1ctoepryyswe.png"></p><br><p>  Everything is bad here: from small things like a careless design to the main message (why, otherwise, the account cannot be restored - this is uncovered blackmail). </p><br><p>  In general, Natasha summed up, we do not write.  Let's move on to other notable examples. </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Hot Letters for Albert</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><p>  <strong>New Innovation Miner</strong> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k_/ad/dh/k_addhx-pzajrqwmmttq3b3ps5m.png"></p><br><blockquote>  Progress without worries. <br>  You have always wanted to touch the world of crypto currencies, but did not know where to start?

Valerie was offered to choose advertising categories - why not take advantage of such an excellent offer? </p><br><p>  The ‚Äúmalefactor‚Äù tried - the link in the letter leads to the site on a free hosting, where in the LJ styles they drew a form for entering personal data and card information. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-l/fx/-w/-lfx-w7toewreosjehvdwtvf75k.png"></p><br><p>  It is very easy to suspect nothing - but it is enough to check the address bar.  Also, when I first opened this link and entered a fictional card, I saw this pop-up: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nw/_f/eq/nw_feqlwom-vurld0bdhi_d5brs.png"></p><br><p>  Warn for good reason - the site is really dangerous. </p><br><p>  Such ‚Äúsites‚Äù on free hosting do not last long and are also filled with watermarks.  And on a paid hosting (and with a second-level domain), you can send a complaint about phishing and fraud.  As practice shows, such sites are actively blocked - for example, our Security Service regularly sends requests to registrars when it detects any new fraudulent scheme. </p><br><h3 id="desktopnoe-prilozhenie-zhivogo-zhurnala">  Desktop application LiveJournal </h3><br><p>  The guys were not lazy and even wrote a desktop application - well, what good fellows.

Of course, I will not upload it. </p><br><p>  Before installing any applications from dubious sources (and mail is a very dubious source), go to the official website and check if it is there at all.
