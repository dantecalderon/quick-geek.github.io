His farewell lecture, <a href="https://youtu.be/4a0FbQdH3dY">“For the Love of Physics,”</a> scored almost 6 million views on YouTube. <br>  We talked about science, teaching, personal interests and the most mysterious objects in the universe: the video version of the interview <a href="https://youtu.be/Ps7NQbEHT98">here</a> , adapted for reading - under the cut. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><p>  <b>Vert Dider: Today our guest is a former MIT professor, one of the most famous physicists and teachers in the world - Walter Levin.</b>  <b>You probably remember his lecture “In the name of physics” <a href="https://youtu.be/iLhl0wMY_uI">in the translation of Vert Dider</a> or his book, for example, <a href="https://www.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru/books/glazami-fizika/">“Through the Eyes of Physics”</a> , which the publishing house “Myth” published in Russian.</b>  <b>Somehow read.</b> <br>  <b>So, Walter, I think we will start with a few personal questions.</b> </p><br><p>  <b>The first and perhaps most important: what inspired you to go to physics?</b> </p><br><p>  <b>Walter Lewin:</b> Actually, the answer to this question is rather trivial.  This is how it all started: I was pretty good at school, I had a penchant for science, but not for languages.  Then I had to decide where to go: I was given a mathematician, but it didn’t fit in my head that I could connect my life with it - so that was by.  I also loved chemistry, but as it seemed to me then, the main thing was to cram there, and not to understand the concepts, but I have a terrible memory - so by.  I still have this choice: biology, living physics, or physics.  In Holland, to study biology, it is necessary that Latin and Greek were in school - I did not have them.  So I chose physics by elimination, not so much from great love.  Who knew that I would fall in love with physics and she would repay me in return: my life is so intertwined with physics that I now say that physics is my life, and art is my love.  By this I breathe. </p><br><br><p>  <b>VD: Glad you mentioned art - this is our second question: what kind of art do you like the most and who is your favorite artist?</b> </p><br><p>  <b>W. Lewin:</b> I have fifty favorite artists, no less.  Although I do not have a formal education in art, I carefully studied art history, my wife holds a Master of Art History, and I even read lectures about her.  Immodest statement, but in art I understand well.  The only thing that interests me in it is the pioneers.  What I like or not is much less important than a kind of invention, breakthroughs.  In physics, the same thing.  My personal preferences play no role, it is important who made this breakthrough.  I will name the creators and innovators of the first quarter of the twentieth century.  One of them is <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587,_%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580_%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587">Malevich</a> . </p><br><p>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D1%2583%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BC">Suprematism</a> changed the world: 1915th, his “White on White” and “Black Square” - they changed the world.  Just like <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD,_%25D0%259F%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582">Mondrian</a> and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE,_%25D0%259F%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE">Picasso</a> , like <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2581,_%25D0%2590%25D0%25BD%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8">Matisse</a> , and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9,_%25D0%2592%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%2592%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587">Kandinsky</a> , and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BA%25D1%2583%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B8,_%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD">Brancusi</a> .  But I single out Malevich among them.  And I can’t have any favorite art workers ... I don’t even have any favorite art direction - they are all so amazing.  Suprematism is a great reaction to post-impressionism, as is Mondrian's <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BC">neoplasticism</a> . <br>  Or remember the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BC">Dadaists</a> .  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D1%258E%25D1%2588%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD,_%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C">Duchamp</a> turned the very concept of art.  He wrote a portrait of Mona Lisa and added a mustache to her, and wrote “LHOOQ” below.  If you quickly read it in French, you get "She has a hot ass."  What is the provocation.  In 1917, Duchamp took an ordinary urinal, turned it ninety degrees, and sent it to an exhibition of a society of independent artists.  They could not refuse to exhibit it: Duchamp was in society.  The exhibit was sent to the basement - scared.  The same urinal, like that, is now worth ten million.  He changed the very concept of art.  Do I like that urinal?  - Well no.  Do I like a work of art, one of the most important phenomena in art, comparable to the “Avignon maidens” by Picasso of 1907?  Is that picture beautiful with girls?  - Nah, ugliness.  I often see her at exhibitions, for example, in New York.  This is probably the most famous painting of the twentieth century.  Disgusting, but the most important. <br>  This means that I do not have a favorite artist, I love innovation, breakthroughs. </p><br><br><p>  <b>VD: Still, it's interesting to ask: you said that you feel the same way about physics.</b>  <b>For example, over the past hundred years, what discoveries in this area would you call the most important?</b>  <b>If we talk about the pioneers.</b> </p><br><p>  <b>Walter Lewin:</b> The most important for the twentieth century? </p><br><br><p>  <b>VD: Yes, the twentieth or maybe even the twenty-first.</b> </p><br><p> <b>Walter Lewin:</b> In the twentieth century, quantum mechanics became the most important discovery, a global breakthrough that happened in the twenties.  Not only physics has changed radically, but the approach to it itself.  We all think in terms of Newtonian physics.  Every person on Earth, even theoretical physicists, think in a similar way.  And why?  - They were born, they had a bottle from which they drank milk, they played with baseball and tennis balls, they threw and caught them ... and each such event is determined - you can throw a ball, “help” him with a racket, and he will be the same to ride <br>  In quantum mechanics there is no such certainty.  That is, we cannot imagine or understand it.  This is the most counterintuitive area of ​​physics, but this is how the world works at the level of molecules and atoms, it is not deterministic.  And this was an incredible breakthrough. </p><br><p>  And of course, in 1905, Einstein and the special theory of relativity.  She turned our understanding of space and time.  Even more surprising thing - it was the year 1915, the general theory of relativity.  She opened for us a new understanding of gravity.  Well, yes, Newton's theories were correct and unusually accurate, but Einstein turned out to be more accurate, presenting small corrections to our fundamental understanding of the world, namely: the gravitational distortion of spacetime. </p><br><br><p>  <b>VD: Since you mentioned gravity ... One of the questions that is now being discussed among scientists is: is it possible to create a particle-based theory of gravity?</b>  <b>Quantum theory of gravity - how likely is it, in your opinion?</b> </p><br><p>  <b>Walter Lewin:</b> This is, of course, a kind of "holy grail" of physics.  If we consider smaller and smaller scales, we will rest on a singularity, the same as in the heart of every black hole.  Singularity has no size.  It has no size, but there is a mass - and what it is!  - It can be a billion times heavier than the Sun.  Or, for example, twenty times.  Accordingly, the density is infinitely large, the size - on the contrary.  What do physicists do?  There is no quantum gravity yet.  Black holes probably have some levels of quantization, but we probably don’t know.  And our only hope is string theory.  They came as close as possible to the creation of quantum theory, but so far it is early to speak about their successes, of course.  Such a theory does not exist yet.  It will be one of the greatest breakthroughs of science. </p><br><br><p>  <b>VD: Do you think there is a chance to open a <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD">graviton</a> ?</b> </p><br><p>  <b>Walter Lewin:</b> This is an interesting question.  If we take graviton as a theoretical, hypothetical particle that transfers gravity in a similar way as photons in electromagnetic radiation transfer the power of electromagnetism ... Yes, for me, this is quite likely.  We can easily measure photons ... Measuring gravitons may not be such a simple task.  Maybe they are wrapped up in some other dimension, and it may turn out to be so small that we will never find it.  So this is a probability with a big question mark.  I do not want to make predictions about whether the gravitons will ever open.  But in general, physicists have almost no doubt that they endure gravity.  By the way, gravitons have no mass .. </p><br><br><p>  <b>VD: No mass?</b> </p><br><p>  <b>Walter Lewin:</b> Very strange particles. </p><br><br><p>  <b>VD: You've already mentioned string theory.</b>  <b>Several people sent us a request to ask you about her, this theory raises many questions.</b>  <b>Theory does not like all physicists.</b> <br>  <b>What do you think of string theory?</b>  <b>Is it helpful?</b>  <b>Will she make any discoveries or learn something?</b> </p><br><p>  <b>Walter Lewin:</b> String theory is very important: only it gives hope, sooner or later, to develop a theory of quantum gravity.  The development of string theory led to some results.  Not to say that significant, but they showed its potential.  Whether scientists have achieved the ultimate goal of string theory, whether they will create a theory of quantum gravity is another question. </p><br><p>  String theory is based on the idea of ​​particles as oscillating strings of incredibly small size, about ten to minus thirty-three degrees of a meter.  It is even impossible to imagine how small they are.  If we increase the atom to the size of our galaxy, to hundreds of thousands of light years, the strings will still be less than a millimeter in size ... I hope I was not mistaken with my calculations ... So, ten to the minus thirty-fifth degree is a very small part of a millimeter.  But, of course, this is not a reason to think that the theory is wrong. <br>  I am optimistic about string theory, but to a large extent it’s like a crane in the sky. <br>  So, the mistake I still crept.  The size of the strings will be a tenth of a millimeter. </p><br><br><p>  <b>VD: Ah, one tenth, that is, even less.</b> </p><br><p>  <b>Walter Lewin:</b> An atom is ten to the minus tenth of a meter, that is, one tenth of a billionth of a meter.  And if this crumb is increased to the size of a galaxy, then one string will be no more than a tenth of a millimeter.  So, in the end, I am optimistic, but ... I can not say anything more. </p><br><p>  The theory originated in the late sixties.  And then, from 1970 to 1995, it became incredibly popular - all leading universities invited only physicists who understood it.  I remember that at MIT (I was forty-three at the time), they also tried to take supporters of the theory — such a peculiar fashion.  But this does not diminish the importance of string theory. </p><br><br><p>  <b>VD: And what are the questions in astronomy or astrophysics ... because you are mostly an astrophysicist?</b> </p><br><p>  <b>Walter Lewin:</b> Yes, that's right.  I wrote my dissertation on nuclear physics — back in the Netherlands, and then I was invited to MIT for two years, and then half a year had not passed, as I became a professor.  And here my sphere of interests completely changed: I abandoned the physics of the nucleus and switched to astrophysics.  The fact is that at this time in astrophysics a whole new direction was opened - X-ray astronomy.  It actually began in 1962, in June.  I arrived at MIT in January 1966.  X-ray astronomy was, so to speak, based in Cambridge, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, thanks to the joint work of MIT Professor Bruno Rossi and Riccardo Jacconi, who worked at the American Corporation for Science and Technology, then the Nobel was awarded to him. <br></p><br><p>  So, a new direction has appeared.  I immediately grabbed him and became one of the pioneers.  Almost everyone who joined these studies in the sixty-sixth, can boast of this title.  I was lucky enough to get into MIT in those two years and become a professor.  All my publications after sixty-sixth were devoted to high-energy astrophysics: neutron stars, black holes and white dwarfs. </p><br><br><p>  <b>VD: Speaking of x-ray astronomy.</b>  <b>Please tell for those who do not know what is so revolutionary about her?</b> </p><br><p>  <b>Walter Lewin:</b> Yes, I think I can explain. <br>  Take the sun.  The amount of X-ray radiation from it is a million times lower than the energy it radiates in the optical spectrum.  One millionth is very, very small, very small part, just tiny.  If in the sixty-second year we placed the Sun at the star closest to us (it is about ten light-years away from us), we would not be able to fix X-rays from it or other similar object from Earth, there were not enough sensitive instruments.  Even looking for X-rays from any stars other than the Sun was unthinkable.  By the way, the first such proposal from the American Corporation for Science and Technology, NASA rejected.  Reason: “C'mon, what kind of radiation do you want to find?” Just because if the Sun were ten light years away, we would not have recorded X-rays from it. </p><br><p>  But still ... some objects were fixed.  X-rays from them exceeded solar radiation by several orders of magnitude.  These were completely new objects that scientists could not even conceive of until then.  X-rays were easily detected throughout our galaxy, and in others too.  It was all about fancy double systems - double stars.  At the same time, in such systems, mass flowed from a star with a burned-out core to a smaller object, probably, to a neutron star or a black hole.  When a substance falls on a black hole or a neutron star, such an enormous amount of gravitational potential energy is released that the temperature of the gas in the surrounding space rises by a dozen million degrees, and this hot gas emits X-rays. </p><br><p>  Thus, we are talking about a powerful source of x-rays with a weak optical.  Many of these objects were then impossible to see in the optical range, only in X-ray.  Let me remind you again: our Sun from a distance of ten light years can only be seen in the optical spectrum, but not in X-ray.  So, X-ray astronomy changed the way we look at the universe, gave us a fundamentally new approach to astronomy. </p><br><br><p>  <b>VD: What questions of astrophysics and astronomy seem to you most interesting these days?</b> </p><br><p>  <b>Walter Lewin:</b> I think that not only me, but many astronomers and physicists would answer your question like this: we want to know what dark matter is.  We want to know what dark energy is. </p><br><p>  There are three types of energy in our universe: <br>  The first is the energy of which we, stars, galaxies and the planet, protons, neutrons and electrons are composed.  We call it hadron matter.  It accounts for only 5% of the total energy of the universe. <br>  Another 27% is dark matter, and we do not know what it is.  There is no doubt that it exists, but that this is a question. <br>  68% is dark energy. </p><br><p>  Just think: most of the universe is dark energy and dark matter.  And we do not know, we have no idea what the 95% of the Universe is.  This is the future of research in physics and astrophysics.  We will find out what is dark matter and dark energy. </p><br><br><p>  <b>VD: If we don’t know anything about them, are there ways to study dark energy and dark matter that give hope of success?</b> </p><br><p>  <b>Walter Lewin:</b> Yes.  There are promising assumptions about so-called <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF">wimps</a> .  This, of course, is only a guess.  But dark matter can be explained by these weakly interacting massive particles.  Their mass is ten to the hundredth degree greater than the mass of the proton, they have not yet been fixed, and they do not interact with the mass, with the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD">baryon</a> mass - this is the problem.  We can not see them directly, only to fix indirectly.  For example, to observe what influence they have on baryonic matter, on the stars of our galaxy, but we cannot find them directly. <br></p><br><p>  So, wimps are not capable of electromagnetic interaction, maybe we will never find them, if only in a roundabout way.  However, these theories are developing, the particles are trying to detect.  Maybe the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2588%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580">Large Hadron Collider</a> will find them once.  In this area, I am not an expert, but the word “wimp” is worth remembering, and even googling — this will help you understand what they are thinking about dark matter. </p><br><br><p>  <b>VD: And maybe we will also find some video and translate it later.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>You said, if dark matter is the same matter as usual, but different ...</b> </p><br><p>  <b>Walter Lewin:</b> Actually, it is not from protons and neutrons.  Therefore, we can not say that it is the same.  There could be no stars out of dark matter ... People would not have come out of it, because we also consist of protons and neutrons.  That is, it is something that can enter into a gravitational interaction, but consists of something else. </p><br><br><p>  <b>VD: But if gravitational interaction is possible for dark matter, can it somehow stick together, condense and form some objects?</b> </p><br><p>  <b>Walter Lewin:</b> This is possible. </p><br><br><p>  <b>VD: Is there any planet?</b> </p><br><p>  <b>Walter Lewin:</b> There is no planet.  Planets reflect light.  Dark matter is not. </p><br><br><p>  <b>VD: Well, some object ...</b> </p><br><p>  <b>Walter Lewin:</b> You are Newtonian.  And I'm talking about protons and neutrons.  When you see, for example, my hand or these glasses, they reflect light.  In other words, it is the interaction between protons and neutrons in molecules and electromagnetic radiation.  And so this dark energy is not capable.  But it is capable of influencing star formation and the movement of stars in the galaxy: this is how we understand that it exists.  Do not even think of blinding a planet out of it - no one knows what kind of matter it is.  If observable objects could be formed from dark matter, it would also enter into electromagnetic interaction, which, as we know, it cannot.  That is, you can not take the radar and reflect its signal from the dark matter.  No radio signals, light or lasers can be used this way. </p><br><br><p>  <b>VD: It turns out that dark matter is not at all like the one we are used to, and 95% ...</b> </p><br><p>  <b>Walter Lewin:</b> No, dark matter is about 27%.  Dark energy is something around 70% if rounded. </p><br><br><p>  <b>VD: And we don't know anything about them.</b>  <b>And besides that, what of the known and observed objects in the universe causes you the greatest interest?</b> </p><br><p>  <b>Walter Lewin:</b> For me, the most interesting objects, firstly, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA">white dwarfs</a> .  I mention them first for a reason.  In 1841, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C,_%25D0%25A4%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2585_%25D0%2592%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BC">Bessel</a> suggested that <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2583%25D1%2581">Sirius</a> is a double star.  In the sky we see only one, but he said that there are two stars.  He declared it confidently, and here's why: if you look closely at the location of Sirius in relation to other stars, it turns out that he moves and describes a circle every fifty years.  According to Bessel, this is possible only in the case of a double star.  Here is a quote from a letter written by Bessel in the forty-first year - this is an important milestone in astronomy, so I will read it, translated into English: </p><br><p>  “I adhere to the belief that Sirius is a double star system consisting of a visible and invisible star.  There is no reason to believe that luminosity is a necessary property of a cosmic body.  The observability of a myriad of stars is not enough reason to disprove a myriad of invisible stars. ” <br>  Once again: "The observability of a myriad of stars is not enough reason to disprove a myriad of invisible stars."  From this began the astronomy of the unseen. </p><br><p>  In 1862, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where I live, where MIT is located, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA,_%25D0%2590%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD_%25D0%2593%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC">Alwan Clark</a> , son of a famous telescope manufacturer, tried his father’s new creation: an 18-inch refractor telescope.  He aimed the lens at the Boston horizon when Sirius rose in the east and then he saw that second star!  Just his telescope at that time was more powerful than everyone else.  Clark named the star Sirius B. Then ... <br>  Now we know the temperature of the star, its size: about the size of the Earth, a temperature of about 8000 degrees.  But the mass is approximately equal to the mass of the sun.  This means that its density is a million times greater than that of water.  It is a white dwarf, a million times denser than water.  When these objects — white dwarfs — were only discovered, no one could believe that this could happen.  Now everyone is accustomed, and we already know billions of similar stars, about the size of Earth, about the same mass as the Sun, with a temperature of 10-20 thousand degrees and a density of a million times higher than water. </p><br><p>  In 1967, a second incredible object was discovered in the sky - <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0">neutron stars</a> .  They were discovered by <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B6%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD_%25D0%2591%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BB_%25D0%2591%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BB">Jocelyn Bell</a> , who at that time graduated from the magistracy.  Her supervisor was Anthony Hewish.  He recorded <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2583%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580">radio flashes</a> in the sky, but there was no optical confirmation.  Flashes appeared once in a whole thirty-three hundredths of a second from one particular place. <br>  This, naturally, was taken as a communication signal from extraterrestrial life.  The object was named LGM-1 ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_green_men">Little green men</a> ) - " <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR_B1919%252B21">Green man number one</a> ."  The information was kept secret: if all this were true, the consequences would have been unimaginable.  Then found another object, very similar to the first.  He was called the “green man number two,” but later the thought of the green men was dropped. <br></p><br><p>  Now we know that these were neutron stars.  And again, in mass, they are about the same as the Sun, but in size they no longer reach the Earth: their radius is about twenty kilometers.  Density is not in a million, but in ten to the fiftieth degree more than that of water.  This means their density is a million billion.  They consist almost exclusively of a substance that is usually found in the nuclei.  Dimensions, remember, a couple of tens of kilometers.  They rotate at a tremendous speed: for some, a complete revolution takes about a millisecond and a half.  Can you imagine an object with a mass of the Sun and a radius of ten kilometers rotates around its axis once a second, and some - once every two milliseconds ?!  Unimaginable!  This is the second interesting object. </p><br><p>  By the way, for them Anthony Hewish won the Nobel Prize in 1974.  What a scandal then!  The scandal due to the fact that Jocelyn received nothing.  It is outrageous that it was decided that way in Stockholm.  Perhaps the reason was that she was just a master, but strictly speaking, it should not have influenced the decision.  Even worse, if the prize was not given, because she is just a woman, which also should not have influenced the decision.  Previously, the Nobel Prize often ignored women.  Now the situation has changed, but Jocelyn was surely cheated ... </p><br><p>  Now I will say about the third and even more strange subject of interest.  It was opened in 1971.  Astronomers who worked on optical telescopes observed a powerful X-ray source called the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259B%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D1%258C_X-1">Swan X-1</a> .  Paul Myrdin and Louis Webster, and apart from them Tom Bolton, found out that he is part of a double star, in which mass flows from a burning star to a compact object. Они заключили, что с большой вероятностью Лебедь X-1 — это черная дыра. Почему они так решили? — Они высчитали массу объекта, и она оказалась более чем в три раза больше массы Солнца. <br> В то время уже было известно, что нейтронные звезды не могут превосходить Солнце по массе более чем в три раза — в этом случае они коллапсируют и превращаются в черные дыры. И так, были открыты черные дыры. Это сейчас своего рода хит астрофизики. Масса черных дыр может быть и в миллиарды раз больше солнечной. </p><br><p> Итак, если суммировать то, что я рассказал, самые интересные объекты во Вселенной — это белые карлики, нейтронные звезды и черные дыры. Черные дыры — самые-самые из них, а последними я их упомянул, потому что рассказывал в хронологическом порядке. <br> Чтобы работать с сингулярностью, нужно разобраться с квантовой гравитацией, так что изучать черные дыры мы пока можем только с определенными ограничениями, и эти ограничения — сингулярность. Но нейтронные звезды и белые карлики тоже ничего. </p><br><br><p> <b>VD: А как на счет кротовых нор?</b> </p><br><p> <b>Walter Lewin:</b> Кротовые норы все еще на стадии предположений. <br> Началась эта история со статьи 1935 года. Эйнштейн и Розен предположили, что можно проложить ход из одного пространства-времени в другое. Общая теория относительности относится как раз к пространству-времени.И если это возможно, то также возможно перемещаться вперед и назад во времени, но подтверждении этому пока нет. Загвоздка с путешествием во времени вот в чем. Если кто-то переместится, скажем, на 60 лет назад, он может убить свою мать. </p><br><br><p> <b>VD: Ну, она тогда была бы совсем ребенком, но...</b> </p><br><p> <b>Walter Lewin:</b> Ну хорошо, на пятьдесят, тогда же можно? И тогда этот человек не родился бы.  This is the problem. Хотя на это есть что ответить, и ответы весьма загадочны. Например, тут возникает и множественная вселенная, бесконечное число наших двойников, и в какой-нибудь из вселенных этот человек как раз не родился и не убивал свою мать. Но в целом путешествия во времени вопрос проблемный. </p><br><br><p> <b>VD: Раз уж мы заговорили о таких вещах, как путешествия во времени и прочие увлекательные мероприятия, то вот вопрос: как вы думаете, вселенная бесконечна? И если нет, то что там, за краем вселенной?</b> </p><br><p> <b>Walter Lewin:</b> Хороший вопрос. А ответ на него: а кто знает? Что нам известно — это размеры наблюдаемой вселенной. Наблюдаемая — то есть та ее часть, которую мы видим благодаря излучению. Если объекты удаляются от нас со скоростью больше скорости света, а такое, скажу вам, возможно, тогда мы не получаем от них никакой энергии — это происходит из-за доплеровского красного смещения. Если посмотреть на изображения так называемого глубокого поля Хаббла, можно заметить тусклые галактики, свет от которых шел до нас 13,5 миллиардов световых лет. То есть мы видим, где они находились больше 13 миллиардов световых лет назад — запомните эту мысль. <br></p><br><p> Однако вселенная расширяется, и сейчас расстояние между нами и этими галактиками уже около 45 миллиардов световых лет. Было 13,5, а сейчас они удалились еще на 32. Сомневаться в этом не приходится — мы знаем, что Вселенная расширяется. <br> Пусть эти галактики все еще что-то излучают, но мы этого зафиксировать не можем. Мы знаем, что они существуют, мы знаем, что они удаляются на скорости в 2-3 раза больше скорости света. И благодаря им у нас есть радиус наблюдаемой вселенной — около 45 миллиардов световых лет. Но увидеть, что там, мы не можем, потому что излучение до нас не достает. Если подождать 10 или хотя бы 5 миллиардов лет и потом посмотреть на те тусклые галактики, которые мы наблюдаем сейчас, их там уже не будет: они ведь улетают от нас на скорости больше скорости света. Не потеряли мысль? </p><br><p> Итак берем эти галактики, ждем 5 миллиардов лет и Хаббл фотографирует то же место… А там уже ничего нет. На том месте будут другие галактики, но тех, которые мы там видели, не будет, мы их не увидим. </p><br><p> О том, что лежит за границами наблюдаемой вселенной, мы ничего не знаем. Может быть, там другие вселенные, может, сестринская вселенная, этих вселенных могут быть сотни, и, держитесь крепче… Согласно концепции мультивселенной, их может быть не то что сотня, а бесконечное число. А если их бесконечное множество, значит, вселенные существовали всегда. Создать нечто бесконечных размеров нельзя, если только наше время не бесконечно. Тут можно выкинуть на помойку концепцию творения, потому что вечное нельзя создать в какой-то момент времени. Эту мысль нам с вами непросто осознать, но если у нас есть бесконечное число вселенных, то вселенные должны были существовать всегда, и никто их не создавал. <br> А ведь творение — важное понятие для религиозных людей. Им нужен вечный бог-творец, который и создает вселенные. Им нужно, чтобы было нечто вечное такого порядка. А нам — нет, у нас сама вселенная может быть вечной и быть всегда. <br> Наверняка говорить пока рано, хотя такая возможность завораживает тех, кто думает в ньютоновских понятиях. Хочу привести один любопытный и непростой для понимания пример бесконечности. Возьмем бесконечное число обезьянок, дадим им бесконечное число печатных машинок. Нажимая случайные символы, некоторые наберут полное собрание сочинений Шекспира. Буквы встанут именно в том порядке, в каком их поставил Шекспир. Такова концепция бесконечности. Мы с вами не осознаем бесконечность. Какое бы огромное число вы не вычли из бесконечности... </p><br><br><p> <b>VD:… останется бесконечность. Кстати говоря, раз уж вы упомянули творение и религиозных людей. Этот вопрос, пожалуй, задают каждому ученому. Вы верите в бога? И как относитесь к религиозному взгляду на мир?</b> </p><br><p> <b>Walter Lewin:</b> Ну что ж. Во-первых, и это очень важная вещь, каждый волен верить, во что хочет. Уважать надо людей любых верований, если они не преступники, если их религия мирная —я следую этому убеждению. Повторюсь: каждый волен верить, во что верит, во что хочет. <br></p><br><p> С наукой история другая. Для науки важны только верифицируемые факты. В религии они не обязательны. Ведь если веришь в то, что тебе нравится, какая разница, можно ли это проверить. И все же я уважаю все религии. Свобода вероисповедания — один из столпов демократии. В любой демократической цивилизации должно присутствовать уважение ко всем религиям. Поэтому во что верю я сам — не важно. Однако по убеждениям я атеист, это мое мнение. И все же, я уважаю тех, кто верит в богов, и надеюсь, они проявят уважение ко мне и моим убеждениям, ведь я тоже могу верить, во что хочу — то есть, придерживаться атеизма. <br> Уважение к любым убеждениям, в том числе к атеизму, это краеугольный камень любой цивилизованной демократии. Если этого уважения нет, то и уважения к стране я не испытываю. Ни к стране, ни к ее лидеру. Одно дело — его религия, но никак нельзя уважать лидера, который навязывает свою религию всей стране, это ужасно. </p><br><br><p> <b>VD: И еще про религию. Если говорить о религиозных и научных убеждениях… Кажется, Нил Деграсс Тайсон сказал, что привить детям интерес к науке можно, если просто оставить их в покое: они ведь и так любопытные, они и так исследователи. Согласны ли вы с этим? Считаете ли вы, что научному методу, научному взгляду на жизнь детей нужно учить?</b> </p><br><p> <b>Walter Lewin:</b> Ну, я бы не сказал, что их нужно учить, но детей, конечно, можно наставлять. Когда ребенку лет пять, можно показывать им чудесные программы по «National Geographic», можно сходить с ребенком в научный музей, можно порешать с ними задачки — я так делал со своими детьми — показать задачку или проблему, которая поначалу кажется неразрешимой, пока не подумаешь получше. Мне кажется, нужно направлять их. А когда подрастут, я бы советовал показать им программы Нила Деграсса Тайсона или Брайана Грина, да и свои собственные видео. <br> Так что я бы не оставил их самих по себе, но если ребенок приходит с вопросом, то нужно и ответить, и подтолкнуть задавать новые, поощрять это. Но я бы не использовал тут слово «учить». Я бы сказал, стоит помогать детям естественным образом расширить их горизонты. Знания ничего вас не лишат, а лишь прибавят. </p><br><br><p> <b>VD: Да, похоже наставничество подходит тут лучше, не обучение. Раз уж мы затронули тему обучения и наставлений. Вы — один из легендарнейших преподавателей, по крайней мере, на YouTube. В интернете вы непреходящая сенсация, и у вас потрясающие лекции. А вопрос вот в чем: вы когда-нибудь думали о том, чтобы преподавать в школе? Направлять умы маленьких детей?</b> </p><br><p> <b>Walter Lewin:</b> Ответ: однозначно нет. Потому что помимо того, что я прирожденный учитель (что уж скромничать), я еще и прирожденный ученый. Закончив диссертацию по физике, я намеревался в первую очередь заняться научной работой, исследовать неисследованное и рентгеновская астрономия подходила как нельзя лучше. И каков же выбор: школьный учитель или профессор MIT? Несложно определиться. </p><br><p> И все же, скажу вам, получив бакалавра, я пять лет работал в Нидерландах, в Делфте, и помимо научных исканий, по 20 часов в неделю преподавал физику в старших классах школы в Роттердаме. Это было невыносимое бремя. <br> Почему я этим занялся? — Мне нужно тут упомянуть причины. Я преподавал не ради денег. Пять лет работы учителем физики и математики позволяли не идти в армию. Я избежал призыва, но еще вот что — правительство выдало мне огромную ссуду на исследования. А каждый год работы учителем сокращал сумму, которую надо было вернуть, на 20%. </p><br><br><p> <b>VD: В течение пяти лет.</b> </p><br><p> <b>Walter Lewin:</b> Да, на выплату был такой срок. Так вот, я пять лет учил старшеклассников, но все-таки не первоклашек. И, поверьте мне, я оказал на учеников немалое влияние — так же, как позже повлиял на своих студентов в MIT, а сейчас на миллионы людей благодаря лекциям в интернете. Но я никогда не учил 6-7-летних малышей в начальной школе. Для моего собственного развития, личной эволюции это было бы не самое естественное занятие. </p><br><br><p> <b>VD: Вы сказали, что вы учитель от природы. Выходит, что вы никогда не учились на преподавателя? И у вас есть свой подход, артистичный и уникальный. Вы с самого начала определились со своим стилем преподавания или пришли к нему постепенно? Как считаете, ваша первая и ваша последняя лекция одинаково хороши?</b> </p><br><p> <b>Walter Lewin:</b> Нет, конечно нет.  See it. Я человек эксцентричный и это было ясно уже когда мне было года 2-3. Если вам свойственна эксцентричность, то свойственно и нестандартное мышление. Понимаете, о чем я? Это значит, что вы стараетесь делать все по-своему. Как я наряжался на лекции в MIT — так никто из профессоров больше никто не делал. Пытался ли я просто понравиться людям своей одеждой? — Конечно же нет. Пытался ли я таким образом произвести впечатление? — И снова нет. Просто я — Уолтер Левин, я всегда таким был и так одевался. Я носил украшения, браслеты или хотя бы какую-нибудь брошку. Сейчас на мне кольца, смотрите, какие красивые. У меня в коллекции тридцать пять штук. Те, что на мне сейчас, я купил в Южной Америке. </p><br><br><p> <b>VD: Круто.</b> </p><br><p> <b>Walter Lewin:</b> Я не стараюсь выделиться за счет этого, я сам по себе такой. Мои лекции, даже уроки в той школе, уже отличались от обычных. Лучше ли они были — пусть решают другие. Но по своему опыту могу сказать, что когда пытаешься преподносить материал по-новому, сильнее вдохновляешь людей. Студенты следят за лекцией, не моргая. Такое своего рода искусство я и развивал всю жизнь. За долгие годы преподавания я понял, что даже в MIT не важно как преподнесешь, важно что донесешь до студента. Задумайтесь: о чем вы говорите, не имеет значения. Есть преподаватели, которые любят хвалиться тем, что говорили с 12-летними детьми о квантовой физике, о специальной теории относительности. Да не важно, о чем они там говорили. Главное — что донесешь, а донести можно любовь к физике. В людях можно раскрыть пылающий огонь и любовь к миру вокруг них, стремление понять его. <br></p><br><p> Я заставляю своих студентов видеть сквозь уравнения, а большинство профессоров пишут уравнения на доске и пугают студентов до онемения. Студенты думают, что физика — сплошные уравнения, но это же не так! Сам я помню уравнений десять, да и все. В физике важно понимание, остальное можно найти. Понятие же о физике как о наборе уравнений в корне ошибочно. На лекциях, как вы наверное заметили, я делаю упор на демонстрации, стараюсь найти что-то близкое к реальному миру, в котором живут студенты. Моя цель — показать радугу, какой они ее никогда не видели, заставить по-новому увидеть облака, по-новому посмотреть на небо. Так что мой стиль преподавания — это принципиально другой подход: мои лекции вдохновляют. </p><br><p> Я постепенно достиг того (я сейчас не преувеличиваю), что могу заставить людей смеяться, когда хочу. У меня врожденное чувство юмора, шутки выходят сами собой, я могу заставить слушать меня с открытым ртом, да хоть забыть, что нужно дышать, могу заставить расплакаться, да и, по правде, хоть штаны обмочить — и это тоже не преувеличение. <br></p><br><p> Иными словами, я нащупал способ улучшить свой исходный талант. Как-то я закончил лекцию тем, что раздал студентам цветы. Когда мы только прошли все четыре уравнения Максвелла, я решил пышно отметить окончание темы об электричестве и магнетизме, чему и посвятил последние десять минут лекции. Я подозвал каждого из своих студентов, а это 600 человек, к своему столу на котором стояли 600 нарциссов.  So here. С тех пор прошло, наверное, лет тридцать. Они позабывали все уравнения Максвелла, а нарциссы наверняка помнят, как и то, какова связь между уравнениями Максвелла и этими цветами. Таков мой концептуальный подход: они наверняка помнят, чем важны уравнения благодаря тем нарциссам. А если им понадобятся сами уравнения Максвелла, они найдут их за пять минут. <br></p><br><p> Принцип моих лекций: показать так, чтобы запомнили. Если я объясняю период колебаний маятника, некой веревки с грузом, масса которого не важна, что кажется не очень логичным, я сам буду этим грузом. Такое на забудешь: профессор раскачивается на конце маятника туда-сюда и рассчитывает период осцилляций с точностью до одной сотой доли секунды! Такое вот объяснение, что разницы нет никакой разницы между грузом в 15 килограмм и Уолтером Левиным собственной персоной. На мой взгляд важно использовать все ресурсы, даже себя, и рисковать, чтобы держать аудиторию и, конечно, по максимуму вовлекать студентов. Вот мой секрет. <br></p><br><p> Needless to say, over the years, and this is 43 years at MIT, I honed my methods. Хотя надо сказать, в последние 15 лет я достиг своего предела и уже мало что менял. Свою последнюю лекцию по физике, прощальную, которую вы, наверное, видели, я бы назвал вершиной успеха. У меня получилось превратить ее в игру, завладеть вниманием людей, и главное — подарить им вдохновение. Там я показал закат, показал голубые небеса, может, и радуга там тоже была, уже не помню. Но в целом по этой лекции видно, какой стиль преподавания я считаю лучшим. Нужно распахивать… Тут как и в искусстве: важен новый, иной взгляд на мир. И я предлагаю этот новый взгляд при любой возможности, новую точку обзора. Например, мне надо объяснить <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2597%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD_%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2583%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0">закон Снеллиуса</a> . Профессор, который говорит про это, по сути о преломлении света и не вспоминает про радугу, просто чокнутый! Ведь радугу-то студенты на всю жизнь запомнят! А в ней суть закона. И она знакома всем. Это и есть новая точка обзора. Расскажи людям о радуге, и они никогда не забудут закон Снеллиуса. Может, они не заучат соответствующие уравнения, но понимание закона Снеллиуса уже никуда не денется. Я описал свой подход к преподаванию в последней главе книги «Глазами физика». </p><br><p> Такая подача — это своего рода новое искусство и новый способ преподавания. Так что я бы сказал, что и в преподавании я своего рода первооткрыватель. </p><br><p> Мне писали, да и до сих пор пишут, тысячи профессоров, что вслед за мной начали применять такие же методы. </p><br><br><p> <b>VD: У нас есть еще два вопроса о том, как вы преподаете. Первый о вашем известном опыте с маятником. Вы подняли мяч к подбородку, а затем отпустили. Сколько раз вы такое проделывали за свою карьеру? Примерно.</b> </p><br><p> <b>Walter Lewin:</b> Я могу назвать достаточно точную цифру, потому что фокус с маятником я показываю в единственной аудитории в MIT, которая рассчитана на 700 студентов. Такие лекции шли всего три дня, зато одна за другой, с 10 до 11 и с 11 до 12, получается, 6 раз. Еще были 8 лекций для японского телевидения, там был этот опыт. Вместе с остальными — 9 раз. Последний раз я устроил такое же шоу на прощальной лекции в MIT. То есть все со всем 10 раз. А вы заметили, как артистично я все обставил? </p><br><br><p> <b>VD: О, да, заметил.</b> </p><br><p> <b>Walter Lewin:</b> Убедил аудиторию, что этот шар меня убьет. </p><br><br><p> <b>VD: Ну вы могли поставить себе синяк. В некоторых видео люди пытаются повторить ваш опыт и получают шаром по лицу.</b> </p><br><p> <b>Walter Lewin:</b> Да, и вот в чем их ошибка... </p><br><br><p> <b>VD: Они его толкают.</b> </p><br><p> <b>Walter Lewin:</b> Тут две тонкости. Во-первых, по мне шар не ударит, потому что я прижимаюсь к стене — прижимаюсь плотно, всем телом. Когда я отпускаю шар, я не меняю положения. В некоторых видео преподаватель разрешает студенту проделать опыт, и, если присмотреться, студент наклоняется вперед, а не прижимается к стене. Есть такое видео, где девушка наклоняется, если присмотреться, она наклонилась сантиметров на десять, если не больше. Смертельный номер! Но со мной такого не случилось бы. </p><br><p> А если бы я толкал шар, смотрите, если вот так держать руки, то не толкая отпустить шар очень легко. Я притворяюсь, что нет, но присмотритесь к моим рукам. Вот так я держу шар.  Do you see? А вот как я их убираю. </p><br><br><p> <b>VD: А, разводите в стороны.</b> </p><br><p> <b>Walter Lewin:</b> Держу шар вот так, мне остается только убрать руки. Я всегда отпускаю шар с нулевой скоростью. Опасности он для меня никакой не представляет, но студентов я убеждаю, что рисков полно: говорю им не дышать, не кашлять… «Если кто кашлянет, у меня рука дрогнет, и тогда я подтолкну шар — роковой шар, из-за которого эта моя лекция станет последней». И мне верят. И задерживают дыхание, вжимаются в стулья, а кто-то и штаны намочит.Это все — часть моей постановки. Это все важно, ведь такое никто не забудет. Это единственное, что никто не забудет. И всегда эта картина будет связана с сохранением энергии. Чего мне и надо. Шар не взлетит выше того места, откуда я его отпустил, отпускаю — и он возвращается туда же. И кстати, он каждый раз останавливается где-то в сантиметре от моего подбородка — это из-за трения о воздух. Воздух в аудитории немного притормаживает маятник, он теряет чуточку своей энергии. Так что шар никогда не касается даже кожи, останавливается чуть раньше. Я чувствую движение воздуха, когда он подлетает, и зажмуриваюсь, но это тоже часть шоу. Закрываю глаза и чувствую, как шар приближается (именно по движению воздуха), выжидаю секунду, открываю глаза и говорю: «Я все еще жив! Физика работает!», Нью-Йорк Таймс публикует цитату дня в верхнем правом углу второй страницы. 19 декабря 2007 они на первой странице опубликовали статью о моих лекциях, а на второй странице как раз была фраза: «Физика работает, и я все еще жив». Забавно, никто даже не знал, что это моя фраза. </p><br><br><p> <b>VD: Еще один вопрос о вашем стиле преподавания. У вас когда-нибудь возникали проблемы с университетом из-за ваших методов? Вот вы разместили в аудитории этот маятник, устраиваете целое шоу, закуриваете прямо на лекции, чтобы напускать дыма и объяснить тему. Были ли с этим проблемы? Бывало ли, чтобы университет мешал вам преподавать так, как вы хотите? Или вам говорили: «Ой, да делайте, как знаете!»?</b> </p><br><p> <b>Walter Lewin:</b> Ну, знаете, MIT это такое место… это рай. Профессорам позволено делать на лекциях все, что они хотят. Меня всегда поддерживали и это люди невероятного профессионализма. Мы вместе устраивали просто огромное количество разного рода шоу, иногда работали вдвоем, втроем, впятером. <br> Обычно план постановки у меня готов недели за три до лекции, мы все обговариваем заранее, иногда для меня что-то конструируют, но чаще не приходится ничего такого делать. С курением неловкая история. Я не курю. Последний раз брал в руки сигарету лет в тридцать. Глупо, но я страдал этой привычкой с двадцати до тридцати лет. Сейчас не курю. Для того своего номера мне нужно было вдохнуть дым. Когда выдыхаешь, дым белый, а если не вдыхать — голубой. Для опыта мне нужно было затянуться один раз. За свою карьеру я проделывал это раз пятнадцать — по одной затяжке. За 50 лет сделать 10-15 затяжек не так уж страшно и совсем не опасно. Видели этот ролик? Я там сначала поджигаю сигарету, она дымит, там такой голубоватый дым. Потом пропускаю дым через легкие: капли воды соединяются с частицами дыма, их размеры увеличиваются, становятся больше половины микрона, что делает невозможным <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D1%258D%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%258F%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">Рэлеевское рассеяние</a> , свет отражается как обычно — как раз это происходит с облаками, из-за этого они белого цвета. <br> Волны в этом случае… При Рэлеевском излучении виден голубой цвет. В других случаях любой свет рассеивается одинаково, поэтому дым от сигареты кажется белым. </p><br><br><p> <b>VD: Да, это как раз было в вашей последней лекции.</b> </p><br><p> <b>Walter Lewin:</b> Такой вот способ объяснения. Но вообще можно и по-другому. Что интересно… Вообще очень важно добавлять элемент юмора. Студентам иногда нужно посмеяться. Когда я раскачиваюсь вместо маятника, видели аудиторию? Да они животы надрывают. </p><br><br><p> <b>VD: Да, мне тоже было очень весело смотреть вашу лекцию. Так что да, это работает. А что бы вы посоветовали начинающим преподавателям? Вы уже сказали, что нужно самому быть увлеченным, нужно интересно и забавно подавать материал.</b> </p><br><p> <b>Walter Lewin:</b> Ну, во многом это должно быть присуще личности самого учителя. Менять свою личность люди или не могут или могут, но с очень большим трудом. В идеале надо излучать любовь к своему предмету — это заразно. Надо излучать любовь к учащимся. Они знают, что я их люблю, по мне это видно. Если использовать любую возможность провести параллель между их повседневной жизнью и опытом и своими лекциями, можно заставить их разделить твой взгляд на мир. <br> Есть профессора, у которых напрочь отсутствует чувство юмора. В голландском языке для таких придумали слово, не скажу какое, оно не самое приличное. </p><br><br><p> <b>VD: У нас никто не знает голландский, так что, если хотите...</b> </p><br><p> <b>Walter Lewin:</b> В голландском очень красочное слово, по-английски я его не знаю. <br> В каком-то смысле нужно быть и эксцентричном, но главное — страсть. Надо гореть тем, о чем рассказываешь. Это сложно дается, и вряд ли этому легко научиться. Вот представьте, я скажу вам или коллегам из MIT, что подготовка к одной лекции обычно занимает от 60 до 80 часов: я делают три полных прогона. Первая репетиция за две недели до занятия, я засекаю время и оставляю пометки в тексте — никогда не укладываюсь и приходится что-то менять. За неделю до лекции прогоняю ее в пустой аудитории — тут уже понятнее, как организовать мои 50 минут. В шесть утра в день лекции я снова прихожу в безлюдную аудиторию и разыгрываю все снова, будто у меня уже установлены все элементы для моих экспериментов, хоть их там и нет. И все же я репетирую, в том числе подхожу к двери аудитории, когда включать и выключать свет, именно затем, чтобы правильно рассчитать время. В MIT студентов не задержишь — они встают со звонком, им ведь и на другие лекции идти. Поэтому нужно уложиться ровно в 50 минут. Возьмите любую мою лекцию: они все от 49 до 51 минуты, не дольше. У меня всегда очень точный план, и я каждые 5 минут сверяю свои пометки в лекции с часами, которые стоят на столе. Если я отстал на минуту, я это отслежу, если две, я уже знаю, что нужно поторопиться, если на три, то все, времени не нагнать. Вот так… нельзя заставлять других так мучатся. </p><br><p> Если взять моих коллег из MIT… Половина из них отличные преподаватели… И многие могли бы подготовить и показать чудесные опыты, на которые у меня ушло бы 20 минут. И у них 20 минут, если правильно подойти к делу, но они не готовятся. Глянут на часы, увидят, что осталось 5 минут, скажут: «Оу, времени уже мало. Ладно, покажу опыт, но объяснять некогда». Это же преступление! Как можно торопить наглядную демонстрацию физики? Мы ведь не клоуны, которые просто показывают фокусы. Если получается только так — это трагедия. Выверить время можно только прогнав всю лекцию. Я так ни разу не прогадал больше чем на минуту. <br> Если на то, чтобы что-то показать, нужно 20 минут (уверяю, у меня в плане прописано, что нужно именно столько времени) — я всегда считаю оставшееся время, и никогда наоборот: в начале стоит 50 минут, спустя 5 минут пишу 45, еще через 5 минут — 40 минут. То есть когда закончить я хочу опытом и его объяснением, перед ним будет стоять 20 минут. Таким образом я всегда укладываюсь по времени, и никогда не отсчитываю наоборот. Итак, я всегда найду эти 20 минут. Ясное дело, коллеги считают это безумием. </p><br><br><p> <b>VD: В какой-то мере это так. С другой стороны, именно поэтому у вашей лекции число просмотров и дошло до пяти или двух… до нескольких миллионов — столько людей их видели.</b> </p><br><p> <b>Walter Lewin:</b> У моей прощальной лекции больше шести миллионов просмотров. А если сложить все, то получится около семи миллионов просмотров в год. Так что за три года мои лекции посмотрели двадцать один миллион раз. Но та самая лекция да, более шести миллионов — это как раз моя самая популярная лекция. Я никогда не думал, что это будет самая известная моя лекция. </p><br><br><p> <b>VD: К сожалению, наше время подходит к концу, но хотелось бы попросить вас вкратце рассказать про ваши любимые фильмы или книги, связанные с физикой: художественные или нон-фикшн, может быть сайнс-фикшн… Которые вы посоветовали бы посмотреть, чтобы проникнуться наукой и, в частности, физикой.</b> </p><br><p> <b>Walter Lewin:</b> Я бы посоветовал одну книгу. Это книга нидерландского профессора <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2582,_%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB">Марсела Миннарта</a> , он работал в Утрехте. Книга на голландском называлась « <a href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_natuurkunde_van_%2527t_vrije_veld">De natuurkunde van 't vrije veld</a> ». «Natuurkunde» значит «физика», а «'t vrije veld» — это «мир вокруг», не комната или дом, а то, что снаружи. В своей книге Миннарт потрясающе рассказывает о радуге, голубых небесах, белых облаках. <br> Например, он рассказывает, как рассчитать размер ряби на воде по Солнечным бликам, которые вы видите на поверхности водоема. Он учит смотреть на мир так, как смотрит на него физик. Это, пожалуй, единственная книга, которая заставила меня самого начать так смотреть. Могу даже предположить, что если бы не эта книга, мои взгляды развивались бы совсем в другом направлении. <br> Миннарт — тот человек, который, метафорически говоря, посеял семя интереса у меня в голове, а потом мне оставалось лишь поливать его, чтобы из него пробился росток. <br> Не было ни одного видео, ни одного фильма, которые бы оказали на меня столь же сильное влияние. Большинство видео, включая и Брайана Грина, и разные фильмы про космос, по мне, отдают дешевкой. Они упрощают объяснения настолько, что это идет во вред науке. Первая «Космическая одиссея» была ничего, но когда доходит до науки, хоть криком кричи, конечно. <br> Наверное, можно советовать National Geographic — они показывают достойные вещи. Они не упрощают науку до искажений. Упрощения есть, но они не приводят к ошибкам, что встречается и у Брайана Грина, да и у других. Это не критика, но все же они в попытках быть понятыми доходят до ошибок, что мне не нравится. <br> Есть еще такая книга… притом очень важная… я когда-то ее прочел, и она у меня до сих пор есть. Ее написал, кажется, какой-то англичанин… Очень известная книга про науку, кстати. Не помню имя автора. Может, даже русский какой написал. <br> Обидно, что я уже имя автора не помню. А ведь это вторая из важнейших книг о том, что такое наука. Усинов? Усинов, кажется, как-то так. Вы такого знаете? Прошу прощения, с памятью у меня проблемы, так что автора не могу вспомнить. </p><br><br><p> <b>VD: И, наверное, последний вопрос, зато один из самых интересных. Если бы вы могли задать вопрос о Вселенной и гарантированно получить ответ, что бы вы спросили?</b> </p><br><p> <b>Walter Lewin:</b> Что такое темная энергия. </p><br><br><p> <b>VD: Вот так просто?</b> </p><br><p> <b>Walter Lewin:</b> Да, конечно. Это же 70%. Я бы не спросил про темную материю, потому что ее только 27%. </p><br><br><p> <b>VD: Ну, и не поспоришь… Что ж, похоже нам пора заканчивать. Спасибо вам большое, и, может, вы хотели бы сказать что-нибудь подписчикам нашей группы, нашего канала для которого мы перевели вашу лекцию и несколько интервью. <br> Нас смотрят студенты, мальчики, девочки, взрослые люди, много кто. Что бы вы сказали российской аудитории, которая увлекается наукой?</b> </p><br><p> <b>Walter Lewin:</b> Постоянно учитесь. Знания ничего не отнимает, лишь прибавляет. Это касается чего угодно. Будь то искусство или наука, биология или починка протекающего крана. Знание только прибавляет, так что учитесь. Особенно старайтесь изучить искусство. Люди обычно считают искусством то, что им нравится, и не считают то, что не нравится. Это принципиальная ошибка. Кто ничего не знает об истории искусства, тот не поймет, что такое прорыв в искусстве. Для этого нужны знания. То же справедливо и для физики. Так вот: учитесь. </p><br><hr><br> Это была расшифровка видео-интервью с Уолтером Левиным. <br> Запись с переводом на русский язык: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ps7NQbEHT98" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br> Также прикрепляем оригинальную версию интервью, без перевода: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ma0SNt9NsKk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><hr><br> 6 февраля 2018 года Уолтер Левин получил нашу посылку с изданием его книги на русском и передает всем привет! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/v5/c6/3h/v5c63hjsqtitslewt84hje4d_tw.jpeg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/410211/">https://habr.com/ru/post/410211/</a></p>
