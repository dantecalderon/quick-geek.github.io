The most high-quality goods receive the Russian Quality Mark. <br><br>  Now government experts have paid attention to the current area of ​​mobile dating apps to determine truly high-quality services.  They performed a huge amount of work: viewed over a thousand questionnaires, wrote over 100 messages in chat rooms, evaluated the safety, performance and convenience of applications.  A total of 119 evaluation criteria were established, 65 of which relate to functionality.  As a result, experts still managed to <a href="https://roskachestvo.gov.ru/researches_international/love/">determine the best online dating apps</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Here’s what the top six apps for Android look like.  The Badoo application won by a large margin: <br><br>  1. Badoo - New acquaintances - 4.5725 <br>  2. Mamba - online dating - 4.3355 <br>  3. Meet MyLove - 4.3273 <br>  4. WannaMeet: Dating nearby - 4,2305 <br>  5. Flirt Chat JAUMO - 4.1931 <br>  6. LovePlanet - dating site - 4.1693 <br><br>  Badoo received the maximum rating for the quality of the terrain map (the maximum score was set if the application <i>did not accurately</i> show the user's location for security reasons) and the maximum possible score on interaction with user questionnaires, a bonus for having a search for "doubles" and maximum chat functionality. <br><br>  Ranking of the six best apps for iOS: <br><br>  1. Badoo - New acquaintances - 4.3965 <br>  2. Mamba chat - dating nearby - 4.3335 <br>  3. Friend Around: chat and dating - 4,242 <br>  4. Meet MyLove - 4.1978 <br>  5. Loveplanet - Dating Near - 4.1693 <br>  6. Tourbar - 4,1139 <br><br>  Experts of Roskoschestvo pay attention that the rating of applications for Android is much higher than applications for iOS.  And this is despite the fact that, according to security estimates, “apps for iOS were expected to be more secure than apps for Android.”  But Android has many other advantages.  In particular, iOS subscriptions are more expensive than Android subscriptions (Mamba, Topface, InMessage, LOVOO; free messages on Android only in LovePlanet). <br><br>  <a href="https://roskachestvo.gov.ru/press/articles/tsena-znakomstva-/">Here's how much you have to pay</a> for paid dating (explanation: payment goes to the developers of the program, not the girls): <br><br>  <b>InMessage</b> <br>  Android 150-450 rubles per month. <br>  iOS 450-1000 rubles per month. <br><br>  <b>Mamba</b> <br>  Android 150-450 rubles per month. <br>  iOS 450-1000 rubles per month. <br><br>  <b>Topface</b> <br>  Android 150-450 rubles per month. <br>  iOS 450-1000 rubles per month. <br><br>  <b>LOVOO</b> <br>  Android 450-1000 rub. / Month. <br>  iOS more than 1000 rubles per month. <br><br>  The authors of the study also noted the low security of dating applications.  So, only Friend Around and iPair applications can set a password.  The LovePlanet, SKOUT, InMessage, and LOVOO (iOS) programs do not encrypt text information, and Tinder, Topface, Teamo.ru (iOS) and Tinder, ParkFace, Teamam.ru (Android) do not encrypt images.  If an attacker (husband, wife, girl) intercepts the traffic of these applications, he can find out which profiles you viewed and even which of them caused you sympathy.  Application security experts Roskoschestvo helped assess the experts of the company Group-IB. <br><br>  Finally, Roskoschestvo recommends that all users of online dating services familiarize themselves with the <a href="https://roskachestvo.gov.ru/press/articles/5-opasnostey-kotorye-tayat-v-sebe-mobilnye-prilozheniya-dlya-znakomstv-/">recommendations of the psychologist Irina Korchagina</a> , who warns about the dangers of this kind of relationship with the opposite sex.  In particular, the psychologist claims that dating applications are a kind of “sexual garbage”.  She explains to the girls: “There, many men (rarely women) carry their vices and dirty thoughts, taking advantage of the fact that everything is incognito, everything is protected by virtual space.  The decrepit old men position themselves as Brad Pitt in their best years and expose a photograph 30 years ago.  Men also often urge a girl to meet in an intimate setting.  And the first question that is asked: “Where do you live?” Or: “Come to you or me?” ”. <br><br>  The psychologist also warns about the effect of the “Internet chemism” when people exhaust their communication in the virtual space, and when they meet in person - they simply have nothing to say to each other: “And then you really do not know what to talk about, how to continue acquaintance.  I remember the anecdote, when two people meet, sit at the same table and communicate on WhatsApp ... But it is still important to regard such mobile applications not as the main way of communication, but as an aid in setting up an acquaintance.  All the rest - at personal meetings.  And so that there is no feeling that time is wasted, I advise you to arrange thematic dates.  For example, you wanted to go to the butterfly museum [or the museum of astronautics - approx.  Ed.], and now you offer a potential friend to go there.  If you don't like it in the end, then you just look at the beautiful butterflies [or rocket engines - approx.  Ed.] ... ". </div>
