Important survey inside</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today is January 25, the student's day, and we seemed to have passed three sessions: we launched the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/tm/blog/435766/">English version of Habr</a> , changed <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/tm/blog/437354/">some algorithms</a> , spent a barrel of WD-40 to <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/tm/blog/437072/">unscrew the nuts</a> , which were delayed for a decade.  More than 2000 comments were sent to the announcements of these changes, many of which are full feature requests.  But suddenly there were those who missed everything and would like to speak?  We keep the rhythm and organize another straight line on the last Friday of the month.  In Moscow, on the street there is nothing to do, we checked.  So let's discuss all the issues in a warm company. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a4b/f0f/e5c/a4bf0fe5c3d7ec7a4e69feda2567a6a9.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As always, you can ask a question to any employee from the list: <br><br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/baragol/" class="user_link">baragol</a> - chief editor <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/boomburum/" class="user_link">boomburum</a> - head of the department to <s>combat</s> work with users <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/buxley/" class="user_link">buxley</a> - technical director <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/daleraliyorov/" class="user_link">daleraliyorov</a> - manager "Habra" <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/illo/" class="user_link">illo</a> - art director <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/karaboz/" class="user_link">karaboz</a> - the main for "My Circle" <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/nomad_77/" class="user_link">nomad_77</a> - chief for "Toaster" <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/pas/" class="user_link">pas</a> - system administrator <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/salenda/" class="user_link">salenda</a> - home for "Freelance" <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/soboleva/" class="user_link">soboleva</a> - customer <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/soboleva/" class="user_link">care team</a> <br><br>  But besides questions, we want to raise a couple of topics for discussion ourselves. <br><br><h2>  Questioning </h2><br>  In us, the hoof beats the desire to make Habr even better, and for this we need not only tsiferki from analysts, but also lively views of the collective mind.  Therefore, we did a fairly large survey in which we ask many questions about how you use Habrom.  If you try, you can keep within 10-15 minutes: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qg/hg/sj/qghgsjzusiuaewiscubk9ry3ftk.png"></div><br><h2>  Donation </h2><br>  Despite the fact that the word ‚ÄúDonat‚Äù has firmly entered into the modern language of communication, we still like the word encouragement more.  The same abbreviation PPA stands for the Program for <b>Encouraging</b> Authors - on behalf of the company, we financially encourage authors for publications that have gained high rates in the opinion of users.  So they thought: why not add an alternative in the form of user promotion?  Especially since you yourself have asked us more than once about this. <br><br>  <b>The concept of the idea looks like this: the</b> user specifies his details in the account settings, these details are attached to the donate button in the author‚Äôs block under the publication. <br><br>  Overseas donations to companies and individuals is a very popular thing and often profitable.  Some publications are more valuable than books - if they met one, then why not treat the author with money?  After all, you pay for a book or magazine, as well as for admission to the conference.  Of course, we are realistic and not sure that this button will be in great demand with us, but why not?  Superficially, everyone likes the idea inside the company, it doesn't seem to be very difficult to do, but can there be any pitfalls?  Describe in the comments (or in PM) how you see this mechanism and how it can be improved. <br><br>  Great weekend to everyone! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/437528/">https://habr.com/ru/post/437528/</a></p>
