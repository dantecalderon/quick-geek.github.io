A few days ago we <a href="https://habr.com/en/company/tm/blog/435766/">launched the English version of Habr</a> and we are very pleased that you warmly welcomed this long-awaited innovation.  It is also pleasant that over the past since the publication of the announcement of multilingualism more than 50 English-language publications have appeared on the site. <br><br>  In the comments to the announcement received a number of proposals for the further transformation of Habr.  Those of them that require thorough discussion and resources, we write in a special notebook.  But there were among the proposals and those that we found it possible to implement immediately, not shelving them. <br> <a href="https://habr.com/en/company/tm/blog/437072/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a52/714/e30/a52714e30a9f7da56a5856928b2bbabd.jpg"></a> <br>  <font color="#999999"><i>Post written with the support of WD-40</i></font> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Changing the rules: copy-paste, cross-posting and advertising </h2><br>  Until recently, the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/info/help/rules/">rules</a> were very tough: copy-paste and crossposting were banned, and advertising-related publications (about a product, service, service, events, etc.) were allowed only within the corporate blog and in the hub of ‚ÄúI promote‚Äù (ignoring this item was the most frequent violation of the rules).  We thought and decided to "unscrew the nuts."  Therefore, from today: <br><br><h3>  <font color="#629d35">Allowed:</font> </h3><br><ul><li>  <b>Cross-posts</b> (publication of <u>their</u> materials, previously posted on another site).  The presence of appropriate marks in the material will be a plus. </li><li>  Links to communities in social networks, telegram channels, chatrooms and profile groups in messengers that are not related to the sale of goods, the provision of services and other commercial activities. </li><li>  Links to personal pages of users in any social networks. </li><li>  Links to personal and public blogs.  At the same time, the blog should only be personal, not lead to the company's website and not be placed on corporate sites. </li><li>  Links to personal portfolio sites of individuals and sites summary (including services " <a href="https://moikrug.ru/">My Circle</a> ", hh, etc.).  At the same time, the resume should not contain references to commercial resources and requests for watering. </li><li>  Links to GitHub and other well-known services for hosting IT-projects and their joint development. </li><li>  Links to open-source and free products sites, if the site does not have paid satellite products.  The presence of paid technical support and donate forms on sites is allowed. </li><li>  A single mention of the company name at the beginning (‚Äú <i>I, an engineer of the Softsoft company</i> ‚Äù) and in the signature (‚Äú <i>The author is an engineer of the Softsoft company</i> ‚Äù).  But it is better to specify this information in the profile settings, then it will be visible in each publication. </li><li>  Links to meetings, conferences, schools and other events with <u>free admission</u> . </li><li>  Links to free games and applications (on GooglePlay, AppStore, Steam, etc.), if they are developed by a private person, for educational purposes or are a test version.  Publication of links to paid games (or with built-in in-game purchases) created by companies or startups is prohibited. </li></ul><br>  <b>Important note 1:</b> in the presence of +30 karma, there is still the possibility of a single placement of advertising material in the hub ‚ÄúI am promoting‚Äù.  For re-publication should be designed <a href="https://tmtm.ru/services/corpblog/">corporate blog</a> . <br><br>  <b>Important note 2:</b> All the links mentioned should not be cut off by link shorteners or contain online marketing tools (UTM tags, Facebook pixel tags, etc.).  Such links will be deleted without warning. <br><br>  <b>And one more important note:</b> all the listed permissions concern only interesting, well-designed and technically competent materials on Habr√©.  If the publication does not meet the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/info/help/posts/">general requirements for materials on Habr√©</a> and is written only for the sake of reference, the moderator will certainly hide it in drafts.  If you have no idea how to write cool stuff, you can read this <a href="https://habr.com/ru/info/topics/toolkit/">manual</a> (it‚Äôs more for corporate blogs, but also for authors). <br><br><h3>  <font color="#9d3535">Still prohibited:</font> </h3><br><ul><li>  <b>Kopipast</b> (placing <u>someone else's</u> material posted anywhere else). </li><li>  All publications, including advertising or mentioning in the commercial key of cryptocurrency and any other virtual currencies and virtual forms of the existence of money, will be hidden in drafts. </li><li>  Links to free resources that collect personal data for commercial purposes (sign up and download a book, training manual, etc.). </li></ul><br><hr><br>  We tried to remember all the problem areas that were, but we understand that all possible situations cannot be described.  Therefore, in some cases, as before, the decision will be made at the discretion of the moderators. <br><br>  Since all changes to the rules are exclusively permissive in nature, we considered it inappropriate to ask the users for confirmation of the fact of familiarization with their text. <br><br>  By the way, at the end of the week we will try to unscrew another small gadget. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/437072/">https://habr.com/ru/post/437072/</a></p>
