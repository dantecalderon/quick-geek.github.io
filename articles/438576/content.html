<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We continue to talk about the most open source projects discussed at Hacker News.  Today we talk about <i>solutions for working with repositories and blockchains</i> . <br><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9">Previous parts:</font> <font color="#A9A9A9"><br><br></font> <ul><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/it-grad/blog/438032/">Cloud management tools</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/it-grad/blog/436962/">Services for working with logs and databases</a> </li></ul><br> <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/it-grad/blog/438576/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/w_/xr/an/w_xranri6qvy6tsugbbus-yhqqg.jpeg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>/ photo by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mulad/3357630065">Michael Hicks</a> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC BY</a></i></font> <br><br><hr><h2>  <a href="https://github.com/go-gitea/">Gitea</a> </h2><hr><br>  Gitea is a system for organizing work with Git-repositories, which allows you to deploy a service like GitHub or Bitbucket on your hardware or in the cloud. <br><br>  The project saw the light in 2016 - then a group of disgruntled developers from Gogs (another Git-server) created its own fork of the project.  They were not satisfied with the organization of management: all the decisions, including the adoption of specific pull requests, were made by the founder of Gogs alone.  This slowed down both the overall development of the product and the release of critical patches.  In contrast, Gitea is a democratic project with a long list of <a href="https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/blob/master/MAINTAINERS">maintainers</a> and annually elected <a href="https://blog.gitea.io/2016/12/welcome-to-gitea/">leadership</a> . <br><br>  The key advantage of the product is its compactness.  Gitea consumes so few resources that, if desired, the server <a href="https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-gitea/">can be run</a> on the Raspberry Pi.  However, its functionality is quite extensive - there is support for <a href="https://git-lfs.github.com/">Git LFS</a> , <a href="https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/425">GPG-signatures</a> and integration with third-party services like Slack or Discord.  Read more about the functions of the program and compare it with its counterparts <a href="https://docs.gitea.io/en-us/comparison/">in the official documentation</a> . <br><br>  In general, residents of Hacker News <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item%3Fid%3D17007216">praise</a> Gitea for its ease of installation and user <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item%3Fid%3D17006691">-</a> friendly <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item%3Fid%3D17006691">interface</a> , reminiscent of GitHub.  Also a plus of the project is the regularity of updates and openness of developers who are set up to communicate with the community.  However, there are those who are <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item%3Fid%3D17006872">convinced</a> that instead of Gitea it is better to use Gogs.  From 2016, it began to develop much more actively and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item%3Fid%3D17006902">acquired new functions</a> that the fork still does not have.  For example, the ability to "switch" between databases. <br><br><hr><h2>  <a href="https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph">Sourcegraph</a> </h2><hr><br>  Sourcegraph is called "Google for code."  The program indexes and analyzes repositories, allowing you to perform complex searches on large corporate code bases.  The system allows you to analyze arbitrary function calls and view related discussions and documentation.  Sourcegraph supports 19 languages ​​and can work with GitHub, Bitbucket and Phabricator. <br><br><blockquote>  The project quickly became popular and in the second year of its existence <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organizations/funding_total/sourcegraph">attracted an</a> investment of $ 20 million.  Now the product is used in companies such as Uber and Lyft, and its founders are <a href="https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/sourcegraph-founders-featured-on-forbes-30-under-30-list">included</a> in the Forbes 30 Under 30 list. </blockquote><br>  In 2018, the code was posted on Github under an open Apache license.  According to the founders, this decision is connected with <a href="https://about.sourcegraph.com/plan">the</a> company's <a href="https://about.sourcegraph.com/plan">mission</a> - to popularize code analysis tools and programming as such.  In general, Hacker News readers welcomed this news positively.  The community <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item%3Fid%3D18117755">appreciated the</a> high speed of the product and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item%3Fid%3D18118022">noted</a> that the release may entail important changes in the industry. <br><br>  But despite the fact that the main Sourcegraph code is open, the company still <a href="https://www.opennet.ru/opennews/art.shtml%3Fnum%3D49382">provides additional paid functionality</a> .  For example, you will have to pay those who want to get support for SSO, external DBMS and extended logging system. <br><br><hr><h2>  <a href="https://github.com/Mojang/brigadier">Brigadier</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Mojang/DataFixerUpper">DataFixerUpper</a> </h2><hr><br>  These libraries are part of the "classic" version of the game Minecraft.  The authors <a href="https://minecraft.net/en-us/article/programmers-play-minecrafts-inner-workings">made them open</a> in June 2018. <br><br>  The first (Brigadier) is responsible for the text interface (command line) available in the game and implements the auto-completion functions.  In theory, this library can simplify the creation of any products that work with text.  For example, it has already been integrated into some bots for Telegram.  The authors hope that translating their text engine into open source will make the tool more user friendly. <br><br>  The second library (DataFixerUpper) is used for incremental assembly, merging and optimization of data conversion operations.  In Minecraft, it updates obsolete game files. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jt/uo/u-/jtuou-wvx8gtvg1-sgump28taza.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>/ photo by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mulad/3357625359">Michael Hicks</a> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC BY</a></i></font> <br><br>  The news of Minecraft’s partial transition to open source has become popular on Hacker News, but has met it ambiguously.  While some commentators became interested in libraries, others <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item%3Fid%3D18156980">felt</a> that the published parts of the Minecraft engine were "pretty boring."  In their opinion, it will be much more interesting to see the code of the game's graphic engine - Blaze3D.  By the way, its game developers promise to open in the future. <br><br><hr><h2>  Hyperledger </h2><hr><br>  Hyperledger is an open source project created to promote blockchain technology, <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/about">presented by</a> The Linux Foundation.  The project is led by Brian Behlendorf, one of the founders of the Apache Software Foundation. <br><br>  Initially, “Hyperledger” included only two solutions based on the developments of Intel, IBM, and others. This is a system for creating exclusive (permissioned) Fabric blockchains and a modular platform for developing distributed Sawtooth registers. <br><br>  He now has eleven applications and frameworks.  Among them is a <a href="https://hyperledger.org/projects/iroha">tool for developing</a> mobile blockchain applications, <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/explorer">modules for analyzing</a> data and <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/caliper">measuring</a> system <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/caliper">performance</a> , as well as <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/quilt">implementing the ILP protocol</a> for connecting different blockchains. <br><br><hr><br>  What we write about in the First blog about corporate IaaS: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/tendencii/na-chto-obratit-vnimanie-pri-razmeshhenii-koda-i-razvertyvanii-prilozhenij-v-oblake/">What to look for when placing code and deploying applications in the cloud</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/tendencii/pochemu-korporativnye-zakazchiki-ispolzuyut-virtualnye-mashiny-a-ne-kontejnery/">Why corporate customers use virtual machines, not containers</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/novosti/kak-dela-u-vmware-obzor-novyx-reshenij/">"How are VMware?": A review of new solutions</a> </li></ul><br>  About virtualization from our Telegram channel: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://t.me/iaasblog/192">What you need to know about hosting PCI DSS</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://t.me/iaasblog/191">Where cloud infrastructure moves in 2019: 5 trends</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://t.me/iaasblog/186">Blockchain in the work of a cloud provider - 3 areas of application</a> </li></ul></div>
