I've had it, and I decided to try to create such a bot player.  Moreover, now there are a lot of tools for computer vision and machine learning, which allow building models without a deep understanding of implementation details.  "Mere mortals" can make a prototype, not building neural networks for months from scratch. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fs/7g/yb/fs7gyb9v-o6bessxnliwetns8u0.png"><br><br>  Under the cat you will find the process of creating a proof-of-concept bot for the game Clash Royale, in which I used Scala, Python, and the CV library.  Using computer vision and machine learning, I tried to create a game bot that interacts as a live player. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  My name is Sergey Tolmachyov, I am Lead Scala Developer in the Waves Platform and teach <a href="https://binarydistrict.com/ru/course/scala-basic/%3Futm_source%3Dblogs%26utm_medium%3Dhabrhabr%26utm_campaign%3Dclashroyale_bot%26roistat_param1%3Dscala%26roistat_param2%3D160219">Scala course</a> in the Binary District, and in my spare time I study other technologies, such as AI.  And I wanted to reinforce the obtained skills with some practical experience.  In contrast to the AI ‚Äã‚Äãcompetition, where your bot plays against the bots of other users, you can play Clash Royale against people, which sounds funny.  Your bot can learn to beat real players! <br><br><h2>  Clash Royale game mechanics </h2><br>  The mechanics of the game is quite simple.  You and your opponent have three buildings: a fortress and two towers.  Players before the game collect decks - 8 available units, which are then used in battle.  They have different levels, and they can be pumped, collecting more maps of these units and buying upgrades. <br>  After the start of the game, you can put available units at a safe distance from enemy towers, while spending units of mana, which are slowly restored during the game.  Units are sent to enemy buildings and are distracted by enemies encountered along the way.  The player can control only the initial position of the units - their further movement and damage can be affected only by the installation of other units. <br><br>  There are still spells that can be played anywhere in the field, usually they cause damage to units in different ways.  Spells can clone, freeze or speed up units in some area. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bk/xs/s2/bkxss2pfmjmvheqvnex86yy2wdk.png"><br><br>  The goal of the game is to destroy enemy buildings.  For a complete victory, you need to destroy the fortress or after two minutes of the game destroy more buildings (the rules depend on the game modes, but in general they sound like this). <br><br>  During the game, you need to take into account the movement of units, the possible mana number and current enemy cards.  You also need to consider how the installation of the unit affects the playing field. <br><br><h2>  We build a solution </h2><br>  Clash Royale is a mobile game, so I decided to run it on Android and interact with it via ADB.  This would allow to support work with a simulator or with a real device. <br><br>  I decided that the bot, like many other AI games, should work using the Perception-Analysis-Action algorithm.  The whole environment in the game is displayed on the screen, and it interacts with it using the screen tap.  Therefore, the bot must be a program, the input of which is a description of the current state in the game: the location and characteristics of units and buildings, the current possible maps and the amount of mana.  At the output, the bot must give an array of coordinates, where it is necessary to tap the unit. <br><br>  But before creating the bot itself, it was necessary to solve the problem of extracting information about the current state of the game from the screenshot.  By and large, this task is devoted to the further content of the article. <br><br>  To solve this problem, I decided to use Computer Vision.  Perhaps this is not the best solution: CV without much experience and resources clearly has limitations and cannot recognize everything at the human level. <br><br>  It would be more accurate to take data from the memory, but I had no such experience.  Root is required and in general this solution looks more complicated.  It is also unclear whether it is possible to achieve speed here around real time, if you look for objects with a heap JVM inside the device.  In addition, the CV task I wanted to solve more than this. <br>  In theory, one could make a proxy server and take information from there.  But the network protocol of the game often changes, proxy servers on the Internet come across, but quickly become obsolete and not supported. <br><br><h2>  Available game resources </h2><br>  To begin with, I decided to get acquainted with the available materials from the game.  I found a <a href="http://discord.me/RoyaleAPI">club of craftsmen</a> who got packed game resources <a href="https://github.com/smlbiobot/cr">[1]</a> <a href="https://github.com/RoyaleAPI/cr-api">[2]</a> .  First of all, I was interested in the pictures of units, but in the unpacked game package they are presented in the form of a tile map (pieces of which the unit consists). <br><br>  I also found footage of units' animations glued together (albeit not perfectly) using a script - they were useful for learning the recognition model. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/b_/bp/zm/b_bpzm14pv9snavxmruq0k5q0cm.png"><br><br>  In addition, you can find csv with various game data in the resources - the number of HP, the damage of units of different levels, etc. This is useful when creating bot logic.  For example, from the data it became clear that the field is divided into 18 x 29 cells, and you can only place units on them.  Still there were all the images of maps of units, which will be useful to us later. <br><br><h2>  Computer Vision for the lazy </h2><br>  After searching for available CV-solutions, it became clear that in any case it would be necessary to train them on a marked dataset.  I made screenshots of the screen and was already ready to mark some screenshots with my hands.  This has proven to be a daunting task. <br><br>  The search for available recognition programs took some time.  I stopped at <a href="https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg">labelImg</a> .  All the annotation applications that I found were quite primitive: many did not support keyboard shortcuts, the choice of objects and their types was made much less convenient than in labelImg. <br><br>  During the markup, it was helpful to have the source code of the application.  I took screenshots every couple of seconds of the match.  There are many objects on the screenshots (for example, an army of skeletons), and I made a modification in labelImg - by default, when marking the next image, labels from the previous one were taken.  Often, they just had to move under the new position of the units, remove the dead units and add several ones that appeared, rather than mark up from scratch. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cx/dh/rf/cxdhrf-uctqed-l84x2mg_9j4u8.png"><br><br>  The process turned out to be resource-intensive - in two days in quiet mode I marked about 200 screenshots.  The sample looks very small, but I decided to start experimenting.  You can always add more examples and improve the quality of the model. <br><br>  At the time of the markup, I did not know which training tool I would use, so I decided to save the markup results in the VOC format - one of the conservative and seemingly universal ones. <br><br>  The question may arise: why not just look for pixel-by-pixel images of units by complete coincidence?  The problem is that for this you would have to look for a huge number of different frames of animation of different units.  It would hardly work.  I wanted to make a universal solution that supports different resolutions.  In addition, units may have a different color depending on the effect applied to them - freezing, acceleration. <br><br><h2>  Why I chose YOLO </h2><br>  I started researching possible image recognition solutions.  I looked at the use of various algorithms: OpenCV, TensorFlow, Torch.  I wanted to make the recognition as fast as possible, even sacrificing accuracy, and get the POC as soon as possible. <br><br>  After reading the <a href="https://docs.opencv.org/3.3.0/dc/d88/tutorial_traincascade.html">articles</a> , I realized that my task does not fit with the HOG / LBP / SVM / HAAR / ... classifiers.  Although they are fast, they would have to be applied many times - according to the classifier for each unit - and then one by one to apply them to the image for search.  In addition, their principle of operation in theory would give bad results: units may have a different form, for example, when moving to the left and up. <br><br>  Theoretically, using a neural network, you can apply it once to an image and get all the units of different types with their position, so I began to dig in the direction of neural networks.  TensorFlow found support for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).  It turned out that it is not necessary to train neural networks from scratch - you can <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tutorials/image_retraining">retrain an existing powerful network</a> . <br><br>  Then I found a more practical YOLO algorithm, which promises less complexity and, therefore, should provide a high speed search algorithm without sacrificing accuracy (and in some cases surpassing other models). <br><br>  <a href="https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/">The YOLO website</a> promises a huge difference in speed using the ‚Äútiny‚Äù model and a smaller, optimized network.  YOLO also allows you to retrain the finished neural network for your task, with <a href="https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet">darknet</a> - opensource-framework for using various neural networks, the creators of which developed YOLO - is a simple native C application, and all work with it occurs through its calls with parameters. <br><br>  TensorFlow, written in Python, is in fact a Python library and is used using self-written scripts that need to be sorted out or sharpened to fit your needs.  Probably, for someone the flexibility of TensorFlow is a plus, but, without going into details, you can hardly take it quickly and use it.  Therefore, in my project, the choice fell on YOLO. <br><br><h2>  Model building </h2><br>  To work on learning the model, I installed Ubuntu 18.10, delivered the packages for the build, the OpenCL package from NVIDIA and other dependencies, I collected darknet. <br><br>  Github has a <a href="https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet">section with simple steps to retrain the YOLO model</a> : you need to download the model and configs, change them and run retraining. <br><br>  At first I wanted to try to retrain a simple YOLO model, then Tiny and compare them.  However, it turned out that for learning simple models you need 4 GB of video card memory, and I only had an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 video card with 3 GB purchased for games.  Therefore, I was able to immediately train only the Tiny-model. <br><br>  The markup of units on the images I had was in the VOC format, and YOLO worked with its format, so I used the <a href="https://github.com/ssaru/convert2Yolo">convert2Yolo</a> utility to convert the annotation files. <br><br>  After a night of training in my 200 screenshots, I got the first results, and they surprised me - the model was really able to recognize something correctly!  I realized that I was moving in the right direction, and decided to make more teaching examples. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ek/rh/ik/ekrhikfcntuxljeawh09ikegnp0.png"><br><br>  I didn‚Äôt want to continue to lay out the screenshots, and I remembered the frames from the animations of the units.  I marked out all the small pictures of their classes and tried to train the network on this set.  The result was very bad.  I suppose that the model could not select the correct patterns from small pictures for use on large images. <br><br>  After that, I decided to place them on ready-made backgrounds of combat arenas and programmatically create a VOC markup file.  It turned out such a synthetic screenshot with automatic 100% accurate markup. <br><br>  I wrote a Scala script that divides the screenshot into 16 4x4 squares and sets the units in their center so that they do not overlap with each other.  The script also allowed me to customize the creation of training examples - when taking damage, the units are painted in the color of their team (red / blue), and when classifying, I separately recognize units of different colors.  In addition to coloring, the damaged units of different teams have small differences in clothing.  Also, I randomly increased and reduced units a little so that the model learned not to depend heavily on the size of the unit.  As a result, I learned how to create tens of thousands of educational examples, approximately similar to real screenshots. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uv/zi/_u/uvzi_uwhmohzcx0a7ylmpbyjady.png"><br><br>  Generation was not perfect.  Often, units were placed on top of buildings, although they would be behind them in the game;  There were no examples of overlapping a part of a unit, although this is not uncommon in the game.  But I decided to ignore all this for now. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zo/wk/uq/zowkuqkijfqocemk7_qflhhgavg.png"><br><br>  The model obtained after several nights of training on a mixture of 200 real screenshots and 5000 generated images that were recreated in the process of learning once a day, when tested on these screenshots, gave poor results.  It is not surprising, because the generated images have quite a few differences from the real ones. <br><br>  Therefore, I set the resulting model to train on a mean sample, in which there were only 200 of my screenshots.  After that, she began to work much better. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Damn shame</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  I apologize for operating with such unscientific measures as ‚Äúmuch better‚Äù, but I don‚Äôt know how to cross-validate images quickly, so I tried several screenshots from a non-training sample and looked to see if the results satisfy me.  This is the most important.  We're lazy and make a prototype, right? <br><br>  The following steps to improve the model were understandable - mark up more real screenshots with your hands and train them on a model trained in the generated screenshots. <br></div></div><br><h2>  Let's get down to the bot </h2><br>  I decided to write a bot in Python - it has many tools available for ML.  I decided to use my model with OpenCV, which from <a href="https://habr.com/company/intel/blog/333612/">3.5 learned to use models of neural networks</a> , and I even found a <a href="https://github.com/spmallick/learnopencv/tree/master/ObjectDetection-YOLO">simple example</a> .  Having tried several libraries for working with ADB, I chose <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pure-python-adb/">pure-python-adb</a> - everything I need is simply implemented there: the function of obtaining the screen 'screencap' and performing the operation on the device 'shell';  I tap using 'input tap'. <br><br>  So, after receiving a screenshot of the game, recognizing units on it and poking at the screen, I continued to work on recognizing the game state.  In addition to units, I needed to make recognition of the current mana level and the cards available to the player. <br><br>  The level of mana in the game is displayed in the form of a progress bar and numbers.  Without thinking, I began to cut out the number, invert and recognize using <a href="https://github.com/madmaze/pytesseract">pytesseract</a> . <br><br>  To determine the available maps and their locations, I used the <a href="https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/db/d70/tutorial_akaze_matching.html">keypoint detector KAZE from OpenCV</a> .  I still did not want to return to the neural network training again, and I chose a method that was faster and simpler, although he eventually had the least sufficient accuracy in the case when you need to search for many objects. <br><br>  When launching the bot, I considered the keypoints for all the card pictures (there are several dozen of them), and during the game I searched for matches of all the cards with the player‚Äôs card area to reduce errors and increase speed.  They were sorted by accuracy and <i>x-</i> coordinate to get the order of the maps - information about how they are located on the screen. <br><br>  Having played a little with the parameters, in practice I got a lot of mistakes, although some complicated pictures of maps, which sometimes were mistaken for others by the algorithm, were recognized with great accuracy.  We had to add a buffer of three elements: if we get three recognitions in a row, we get the same values, then we conditionally believe that we can trust them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vr/8a/mj/vr8amjw6_mpuh8kzethfk0zbkya.png"><br><br>  After getting all the necessary information (units and their approximate position, available mana and maps), you can make some decisions. <br><br>  To begin with, I decided to take something simple: for example, if I have enough mana for an available card, I can play it on the field.  But the bot still does not know how to ‚Äúplay‚Äù cards - he knows what cards we have, where the field is, you have to click on the desired card, and then on the desired cell on the field. <br><br>  Knowing the resolution of the screenshot, you can understand the coordinates of the map and the desired cells of the field.  Now I am tied to the exact screen resolution, but if necessary, this can be abstracted from.  The decision function will return an array of clicks that need to be done in the near future.  In general, our bot will be an infinite loop (simplified): <br><br><pre><code class="plaintext hljs">–±–µ—Å–∫–æ–Ω–µ—á–Ω–æ:    –∏–∑–æ–±—Ä–∞–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ = –ø–æ–ª—É—á–∏—Ç—å –∏–∑–æ–±—Ä–∞–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ    –µ—Å–ª–∏ –µ—Å—Ç—å –¥–µ–π—Å—Ç–≤–∏—è:        —Å–¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å –¥–µ–π—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ(–ø–µ—Ä–≤–æ–µ –¥–µ–π—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ)        –Ω–µ–±–æ–ª—å—à–∞—è –∑–∞–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∫–∞ –¥–ª—è –ø—Ä–∞–≤–¥–æ–ø–æ–¥–æ–±–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏    –∏–Ω–∞—á–µ:        —é–Ω–∏—Ç—ã = —Ä–∞—Å–ø–æ–∑–Ω–∞–µ–º —é–Ω–∏—Ç–æ–≤(–∏–∑–æ–±—Ä–∞–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ)        –∫–∞—Ä—Ç—ã = —Ä–∞—Å–ø–æ–∑–Ω–∞–µ–º –∫–∞—Ä—Ç—ã(–∏–∑–æ–±—Ä–∞–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ)        –º–∞–Ω–∞ = —Ä–∞—Å–ø–æ–∑–Ω–∞–µ–º –º–∞–Ω—É(–∏–∑–æ–±—Ä–∞–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ)        –¥–µ–π—Å—Ç–≤–∏—è += –∞–Ω–∞–ª–∏–∑(–∏–∑–æ–±—Ä–∞–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ, —é–Ω–∏—Ç—ã, –∫–∞—Ä—Ç—ã, –º–∞–Ω–∞)</code> </pre> <br><br>  So far, the bot can only put units at one point, but already has enough information to build a more complex strategy. <br><br><h3>  First problems </h3><br>  In reality, I was faced with an unexpected and very unpleasant problem.  Creating a screenshot via ADB takes about 100 ms, which introduces a significant delay - I expected this maximum delay, taking into account all the calculations and the choice of action, but not at one step of creating a screenshot.  Simple and quick solutions could not be found.  In theory, using the Android emulator, you can take screenshots directly from the application window, or you can make a utility to stream the image from the phone with compression via UDP and connect to it with a bot, but I did not find quick solutions either. <br><br><h2>  so </h2><br>  Soberly assessing the state of my project, I decided to stop on this model for now.  I spent a few weeks of my free time on this, but the recognition of units is only part of the gameplay. <br><br>  I decided to develop parts of the bot gradually - to make the basic logic of perception, then the simple logic of the game and interaction with the game, and then it will be possible to improve the individual subsiding parts of the bot.  When the level of model recognition units becomes sufficient, adding information about HP and the level of units can lead the development of a game bot to a new level.  Perhaps this will be the next goal, but for now you definitely should not dwell on this task. <br><br>  <a href="https://github.com/clash-royale-bot-project/clash-royal-bot">Project repository on Github</a> <br><br>  I spent a lot of time on the project and, to be honest, I was tired of it, but I don‚Äôt regret a bit - I got a new experience in ML / CV. <br><br>  Maybe I will come back to him later - I will be glad if someone joins me.
