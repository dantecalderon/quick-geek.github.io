One of the main concerns is to provide an understandable pattern of professional growth, so that designers are interested and they feel that they can become stronger.  Personnel personnel have long used skill cards and skills (competency cards) that help highlight the strengths and weaknesses of an employee, and then swing them purposefully.  The tool is not new, but the designers only read about it a few years ago.  I collected examples of maps from Basecamp, Buzzfeed, Coryndon Luxmoore, Facebook, Figma, Lyst, Mail.ru, Ope, Peter Merholz and Zendesk. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ded/592/cd9/ded592cd9d4bdd21e216227e60eae2ce.gif"><br><br><h4>  <a href="https://vk.com/%40pdigest-maturity-01">Design maturity models</a> </h4><br>  <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/design-better/design-maturity-model/">InVision offered their design maturity model</a> .

As usual, they showed a lot of plague and plague things.  The most interesting thing about the interfaces: voice interfaces are embedded in the shower and key chains, the first flexible screen phone can already be bought, a ton of household appliances, car interfaces, wearable devices, virtual and augmented reality, TVs and, of course, odor emitters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fu/dc/rm/fudcrmqvyitauqvqccz_hcuivwu.jpeg"><br><br><h1>  Voice Interfaces </h1><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/01/03/microsoft-patent-whisper-voice-assistants/">Microsoft patent suggests you inhale whisper to your voice assistants</a> </h4><br>  Microsoft offered to add the ability to give commands to voice assistants in a whisper.  More precisely, they read the breath during silently pronouncing the phrase.  This is great to help in situations where you need to observe silence - they have always been considered a weak point of voice interfaces. <br><br><h4>  Flexible screens </h4><br>  Concepts and living products is becoming more.  And we have not yet come to see the <a href="https://www.mwcbarcelona.com/">Mobile World Congress</a> on February 25-28, where there will definitely be even more.  It seems that an interesting movement will finally begin in mobile interfaces, where everything has become too predictable. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.royole.com/flexpai">Royole FlexPai</a> </h4><br>  Royole took the title of the first commercial product from Samsung - you can already buy it.  It comes with an external folding keyboard, which makes the overall impression even more futuristic.  <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/01/07/royole-flexpai-hands-on/">Review</a> . <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kdioGiIYrXk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/01/23/xiaomi-foldable-phone-video/">Xiaomi</a> </h4><br>  Officially, they showed a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/01/03/xiaomi-three-panel-foldable-phone/">previously lost</a> concept of their flexible phone.  It decomposes in two directions. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K-q8NGcGvmY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/01/21/motorola-razr-foldable-phone-patent/">Motorola RAZR</a> </h4><br>  Patent teaser new generation of the legendary phone in the performance with a flexible screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/102/a2e/e48/102a2ee48dc91324831f1f83df532c5e.jpg"><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/r000pert/hyper-hyper-how-to-deal-with-trends-fads-and-constant-change">Hyper!</a>  <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/r000pert/hyper-hyper-how-to-deal-with-trends-fads-and-constant-change">Hyper !!!</a>  <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/r000pert/hyper-hyper-how-to-deal-with-trends-fads-and-constant-change">How to deal with trends, fads and constant change</a> </h4><br>  The presentation of Rupert Platz, though it was published a year and a half ago, is as fresh as ever - it teaches us to separate useless HYIP hacks from really useful methods and best practices.  Through this approach, you can drive away any hot topic and understand for yourself whether it is necessary to run after it. <br><br><h4>  Car Interfaces </h4><br>  The new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/01/08/mercedes-benz-cla-coupe-unveil/">Mercedes CLA offers gesture management out of the box</a> . <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://jnd.org/community-based-human-centered-design/">Community-Based, Human-Centered Design</a> </h4><br>  Don Norman and Eli Spencer say that the profession should move towards helping local communities to look for design solutions themselves.  Designers in this vision serve as facilitators who teach ordinary people professional approaches and methods. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://thomasbyttebier.be/blog/brands-beyond-the-interface">Beyond the interface</a> </h4><br>  Thomas Byttebier also ponders why modern digital products and brands have become the same.  This happens in other areas - fashion, cafes, etc. <br><br><h4>  Virtual and Augmented Reality </h4><br>  <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/01/designing-emotional-interfaces-future/">Gleb Kuznetsov collected many of his interface concepts in the context of the trend for emotionality</a> . <br><br>  <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/01/29/ford-gravity-sketch/">Ford designers are designing some cars in virtual reality</a> . <br><br>  <a href="https://uxplanet.org/6-interesting-concepts-for-ar-experiences-359193eb1ad5">Nikolay Babich collected a selection of interesting application concepts using augmented reality</a> . <br><br><h1>  For general and professional development </h1><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.viget.com/articles/design-ethics-and-the-limits-of-the-ethical-designer/">Design Ethics and the Limits of the Ethical Designer</a> </h4><br>  Viget Curt Arledge speaks about the complexity of implementing design ethics, because our influence on infrastructure and business levels is extremely limited, and most of the problems come from there. <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://uxwritinghub.com/">UX Writing Hub - One Stop Shop for UX Writers</a> </h4><br>  Online course on texts in the interface from Yuval Keshtcher. <br><br><h1>  People and companies in the industry </h1><br><h4>  <a href="https://phase.com/magazine/design-ecosystem-in-moscow/">Design Ecosystem in Moscow</a> </h4><br>  Phase do reviews of how design works in different cities of the world and released a story about the professional ecosystem in Moscow.  I put in five kopecks about why we have a fairly mature and strong market and which teams should be watched. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1d5/056/dcf/1d5056dcf36db136270906c5775206a9.jpg"><br><br>  About domestic design is not particularly audible abroad.  The market is big enough for companies to work enough for an internal audience, so they don‚Äôt have a pressing need to glow globally.  As a result, most of the coolness that is happening does not go into the international community, although there are plenty of really strong products and teams.  And the most annoying thing is that the domestic designers themselves are making themselves too stinky.  Of course, there are enough weak specialists, like everywhere else.  But it is more correct to look at the big picture, and it is at a good level. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/12/17/future-interfaces-group-carnegie-mellon-university-video-tour/">Speculative gadgets at the Future Interfaces Group</a> </h4><br>  The story of the research laboratory <a href="http://www.figlab.com/">Future Interfaces Group</a> , working within the Carnegie Mellon University. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://medium.com/yandex-design">Yandex Design</a> </h4><br>  Blog design team Yandex. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://spotify.design/">Spotify Design</a> </h4><br>  Spotify design team blog. <br><br><h1>  Conference proceedings </h1><br><h4>  <a href="https://vk.com/%40pdigest-events-2019">Design Conferences in 2019</a> </h4><br>  A good <a href="https://design-conferences-2019.com/">catalog of design conferences for 2019 has been</a> launched.  Now there are 117 events around the world. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6ab/a09/b52/6aba09b52f1c58ff07562f9730df1df0.jpg"><br><br>  Advanced PC users have long known about <a href="https://www.finduxevents.com/">Find UX Events</a> - the best source and knowledge base for design events, where there is data for a couple of years ahead ( <a href="https://www.finduxevents.com/ux-conferences-2019/">their collection</a> ).  Unfortunately, the death of the brave was another explanatory directory, <a href="http://lanyrd.com/">Lanyrd</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d72/bb7/67e/d72bb767e04ef2db15bbe9a4e8a4af6f.png"><br><br>  For a long time, selections based on such directories have been done by Smashing Magazine, but have recently ceased.  <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/the-best-ux-design-conferences-2019-events-bcd7b28f722d">Banner intercepted UX Collective</a> . <br><br>  Apparently, the conference lists will be launched more than once.  For example, <a href="https://designconf.site/">designconf.site</a> has just opened.  Not the most complete, but to the heap.  <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jMa4aOuq2eahfPfhBttGZNS0PIm1CS39zyJUS3KLieY/edit">The table</a> from which they take data. <br><br>  I attended a decent number of domestic and international conferences, festivals, workshops and meetings in recent years.  I made a conclusion for myself that ** there are two types of content and visiting them is a task: <br><br><h4>  Mathematical conferences </h4><br>  This is primarily about inspiration, because it is difficult to expect targeted pumping of some skills from the content about everything at once.  You will get a good cut of what they are talking about in the profession, and a charge of cheerfulness to keep up with the trends.  In this regard, I liked <a href="http%253A%252F%252Famuseconf.com%252F%26cc_key%3D">Amuse</a> (Budapest), <a href="https%253A%252F%252Fux-lx.com%252F%26cc_key%3D">UXLx</a> (Lisbon) and <a href="https%253A%252F%252Fofff.barcelona%252F%26cc_key%3D">OFFF</a> (Barcelona).  <a href="https%253A%252F%252Fdesign.google%252Flibrary%252Fspan%252F%26cc_key%3D">Google SPAN</a> (London) was interesting.  From home, the <a href="http%253A%252F%252Fdesignweekend.ru%252F%26cc_key%3D">Design Weekend</a> (different cities) and our <a href="http%253A%252F%252Fdribbblemeetup.ru%252F%26cc_key%3D">Mail.ru Design Conference √ó Dribbble Meetup</a> (Moscow) work well.  I have long wanted to go to Awwwards Conference and Interaction. <br><br><h4>  Highly specialized </h4><br>  Design management, design systems, branding, typography, etc.  This is a cool way to pump a specific skill and deepen knowledge in the subject.  Here <a href="https://www.lxconference.com/">MXConference / LXConference</a> (San Francisco) and <a href="http://designops.co/">DesignOps Summit</a> (New York) on design management, <a href="http://serebronabora.com/">Silver set</a> (Moscow) on typography are well <a href="https://www.lxconference.com/">received</a> .  Somewhere at the junction between the two formats <a href="https://futurelondonacademy.co.uk/">Future London Academy</a> (London).  Strong disappointment - <a href="http://clarityconf.com/">Clarity</a> (San Francisco), allegedly by design systems.  This year I‚Äôll go to <a href="https://underconsideration.com/brandnewconference/">Brand New</a> (USA) for branding and <a href="https://leadingdesignconf.com/">Leading Design</a> (London) for design management. <br>  Therefore, I often answer the question ‚Äúwhat conference would you advise?‚Äù Depending on what you want to know.  I described my approach above. <br><br>  Separately, I note that it is critical to actively listen and ask questions.  Many expect that simply arriving in a beautiful room with chic speakers on them will automatically shed the rays of knowledge.  Nifiga, guys - at conferences it is important to carefully listen, take notes and ask questions to speakers.  Otherwise, you will just cheer up and bring souvenirs, and then you will be Snuffled, they say, not surprised. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://designleadership.io/summit-2018/">Design Leadership Summit 2018</a> </h4><br>  The Design Leadership Summit 2018 Design Management Conference was held on September 29 in Toronto.  Published video recordings of speeches. <br><br><blockquote>  <strong>Subscribe to a digest</strong> on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/pdigest/">Facebook</a> , <a href="https://vk.com/pdigest">VKontakte</a> , <a href="https://t.me/pdigest">Telegram</a> or <a href="http://eepurl.com/bu61XX">by mail</a> - there fresh links appear every week.
