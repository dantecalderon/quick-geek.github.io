Under this program, the implementation of passenger cars for the month amounted to 28,005 units (an excellent growth - 291.62% in annual terms), among which sales of connected hybrids increased by 65.79% to 11,786 units.  It is also worth noting that 16,219 units of electric vehicles with batteries were sold, which led to astounding growth - 38,516.67%. <br><br>  Despite low sales volumes of commercial vehicles, this was also a significant increase in annual terms - 270.39% (663 units, including 544 buses). <br><br>  Sales of fossil fuel vehicles have experienced a significant decline.  The largest falls were observed among compacvans and amounted to 66.6% (5033 units).  In addition, sedans and utility vehicles sales fell by 64.95% and 22.37% respectively, compared with last year, to 4,330 and 5,889 units. <br><br>  The installed capacity of automotive and stationary rechargeable batteries for BYD for the first month of 2019 was approximately 1.55 GWh. <br><br>  The goal of BYD in 2019 is to sell 650 thousand vehicles, launch 9 or 10 new models, including the new BYD Tang EV600, the Song MAX DM, the Yuan EV535 and the Song Pro, etc. <br><br>  Source: Gasgoo </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/440942/">https://habr.com/ru/post/440942/</a></p>
