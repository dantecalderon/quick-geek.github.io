The company advertises a new offer as a faster and easier backup for customers.  It can be customized on a regular basis or carried out upon request. <br><br>  AWS Backup stores files from several services, including DynamoDB, Elastic Block Store (EBS), Elastic File System (EFS), Relational Database Service (RDS), and AWS Storage Gateway.  In the future, plan to add other services.  Through the AWS Storage Gateway, backups are made from the local system, that is, from a personal or work computer. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Backups are stored on S3 hosting, and the oldest backups can be transferred to the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/glacier/">Amazon Glacier</a> long-term storage, which is much cheaper than S3.  Insiders <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/10/18/ipexpo_2012/">said</a> the files were stored on tape cartridges there, but that’s not certain. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9a4/dae/084/9a4dae084cb585259328ce62bb728a8d.png"><br><br>  Amazon notes that it provides not just technical services, but “a ready-made backup strategy at the enterprise level and its implementation tools,” so you can choose a daily, weekly, or monthly backup strategy.  The cost does not differ from conventional backups in AWS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3f4/521/0cc/3f45210cc0f8c739c77c21dc229d5533.png"><br><br>  AWS Backup allows you to automate and centrally manage backups.  Policy-based backup plans are created from the center console.  It also monitors the status of current backups, search / restore backups. <br><br>  Each plan includes one or more rules.  It shows the backup schedule, frequency and window for backup.  Files for copying are set either explicitly or by policies via tags.  The rules also set the storage levels and expiration of old backups. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/964/983/c07/964983c07db6dc140f408e49fdc95bcf.png"><br><br>  Backup copies are grouped into storages, each of which is encrypted with a KMS key. </div>
