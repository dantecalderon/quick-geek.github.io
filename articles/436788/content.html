<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Use the Office Deployment Tool (ODT) to set up and deploy corporate versions of Office 2019 in your organization, including Project and Visio (and other programs). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Installation files for Office 2019 are available directly from the CDN Office network, i.e.  Windows packages (MSI) are no longer used. <br><br>  In fact, this means that on one computer you will have one installation of 2019 Office, and it will be impossible to install any other Office package. <br><br>  <i>For example</i> : you purchased Office 2019 Standard, you installed it on a user's computer and you plan to install Skype for Business Basic using an MSI installer - this will not work.  And, even if you download a Skype for Business Click to Run package from office 365, it will not install either.  Sorry, I repeat: there can be only <b>one installation of Office 2019</b> on a computer, regardless of how an additional Office product is distributed. <br><br><h3>  And so, you need to create one package for deploying Office 2019. </h3><br>  Download Office Deployment Tools from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx%3Fid%3D49117">the Microsoft Download Center</a> .  After receiving a copy of ODT, you need to create a configuration.xml configuration file. <br><br>  You can create multiple configuration.xml files that will be used with ODT. <br><br>  <i>What it is for:</i> you can install Office 2019 directly from the Office CDN network, or you can download installation files from the CDN Office network to a folder on the local network, for example, to a shared folder and install Office 2019 from this location.  You can use different methods for different sets of computers in your organization. <br><br>  To create a configuration file, I recommend using the <a href="https://config.office.com/">Office Customization Tool</a> .  Using this site you can generate a response file for Office 365 / Office 2019 with basic settings such as: <br><br><ul><li>  office architecture version; </li><li>  products, components and languages; </li><li>  installation options (CDN Office or Local Source); </li><li>  type of licensing. </li></ul><br>  And supplement it with product identifiers supported by the Office Deployment Tool.  Here are the main ones: <br><br>  <b>Skype for Busies</b> <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Product </td><td>  Product id </td></tr><tr><td>  Skype for Business Basic 2015 <br>  Skype for Business 2015 <br>  Skype for Business Basic 2016 <br>  Skype for Business 2016 <br>  Skype for Business 2019 <br>  Skype for Business 2019 (volume licensed) <br>  Skype for Business Basic 2019 </td><td>  LyncEntryRetail <br>  LyncRetail <br>  SkypeforBusinessEntryRetail <br>  SkypeforBusinessRetail <br>  SkypeforBusiness2019Retail <br>  SkypeforBusiness2019Volume <br>  SkypeforBusinessEntry2019Retail </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  <b>Other products</b> <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  AccessRetail <br>  Access2019Retail <br>  Access2019Volume <br>  ExcelRetail <br>  Excel2019Retail <br>  Excel2019Volume <br>  HomeBusinessRetail <br>  HomeBusiness2019Retail <br>  HomeStudentRetail <br>  HomeStudent2019Retail <br>  O365HomePremRetail <br>  Onenoteretail <br>  OutlookRetail <br>  Outlook2019Retail <br>  Outlook2019Volume <br>  Personal2019Retail <br>  Powerpointretail <br>  PowerPoint2019Retail <br>  Powerpoint2019volume <br>  ProfessionalRetail <br>  Professional2019Retail <br>  ProjectProXVolume </td><td>  ProjectPro2019Retail <br>  ProjectPro2019Volume <br>  ProjectStdRetail <br>  ProjectStdXVolume <br>  ProjectStd2019Retail <br>  ProjectStd2019Volume <br>  ProPlus2019Volume <br>  PublisherRetail <br>  Publisher2019Retail <br>  Publisher2019Volume <br>  Standard2019Volume <br>  VisioProXVolume <br>  VisioPro2019Retail <br>  VisioPro2019Volume <br>  VisioStdRetail <br>  VisioStdXVolume <br>  VisioStd2019Retail <br>  VisioStd2019Volume <br>  WordRetail <br>  Word2019Retail <br>  Word2019Volume <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2842297/product-ids-that-are-supported-by-the-office-deployment-tool-for-click">The official link to the supported products (which I have been looking for for a long time).</a> <br><br><h3>  Install Office 2019 using the Office Deployment Tool </h3><br>  After obtaining the ODT and creating the configuration.xml configuration file, you can install Office 2019. <br><br>  Open an elevated command prompt, navigate to the folder where you saved the ODT and the configuration.xml file, and enter the following command to download the installation package to a network folder: <br><br><ul><li>  setup / download configuration.xml </li></ul><br>  then enter the command: <br><br><ul><li>  setup / configure configuration.xml </li></ul><br>  to install Office from a network folder or directly from the CDN Office network.  Wait for the Office installation to complete. <br><br>  From experience, I would say that it is better to test the installation of a package from the CDN Office network, and then create a local package. <br><br>  Just in case, I provide a full list of ODT commands: <br><br> <code>SETUP /download [path to configuration file] <br> SETUP /configure [path to configuration file] <br> SETUP /packager [path to configuration file] [output path] <br> SETUP /customize [path to configuration file] <br> SETUP /help <br></code> <br>  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/ru-ru/deployoffice/office2019/deploy">Deployment Guide for Office 2019 from Microsoft.</a> <br><br>  Please note that the Office Customization Tool site already contains codes for Project / Visio 2016, but they are not on the Product IDs site that are supported by the Office Deployment Tool. <br>  Microsoft is Microsoft. <br><br>  Hope this article will save your time. </div>
