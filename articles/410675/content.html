<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  SWG has released VILLY lamps with a large set of mounts and deflectors, combining which you can get dozens of "different" lamps. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8c9/718/886/8c971888633ecbff346685702f745c14.jpg"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The base of the luminaire is a black or white metal cylinder (diameter 65 mm, length 145 mm) with a warm (3000K) or neutral (4000K) light LED module and a non-dimmable driver. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5d8/675/060/5d86750607209a821a426f6341482122.jpg"></div><br>  Additionally, five types of mounting, three types of deflectors and a dimmable driver are sold. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4ad/246/e58/4ad246e588769709fde0a1faeac11d4b.jpg"></div><br>  The declared power of luminaires is 15 W, the declared luminous flux is 900 lm for lamps with warm light and 1050 lm for lamps with neutral light.  Lighting angle - 60 degrees.  The lamp gives a circle of light with a blurred contour. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e07/fb7/073/e07fb707319976b66289e32cc8296334.jpg"></div><br>  On the back cover of the base of the lamp there are slots that allow to fix the lamp on the ceiling. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1c4/817/524/1c48175245102caebc6512656555cc75.jpg"></div><br>  Additional mounts extend the installation of the lamp and allow you to install lamps at an angle. <br><br>  Fasteners for surface-mounted installation on the ceiling and plasterboard ceiling. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8be/700/3de/8be7003defb35fe239de1cd80a8f922d.jpg"></div><br>  Lamps are rotated to the desired angle. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ce1/ca6/dd2/ce1ca6dd263dcc425cc19e913875681d.jpg"></div><br>  Rod mount.  It is also possible to rotate from vertical to horizontal position of the lamp. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c56/1ff/879/c561ff879957b5db205bc68b857bc5ad.jpg"></div><br>  Track swivel mount. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d43/056/568/d43056568d2a57e6c385187555597a48.jpg"></div><br>  Suspension <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/570/15d/c65/57015dc65ff8982f480b5e6c3fae1515.jpg"></div><br>  Color deflectors allow you to change the appearance of lamps.  On the black lamp instead of the standard deflector, you can install white, and on white black.  Golden and silver deflectors can be installed on lamps of both colors. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c1e/5a9/1d6/c1e5a91d6dbe0b9be20757c193072bc8.jpg"></div><br>  Another additional deflector - acrylic, translucent. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/291/50b/d6f/29150bd6f359567359e7ae3835667d9d.jpg"></div><br>  The edge of this deflector creates a luminous strip on the edge of the lamp. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3df/bbf/0e5/3dfbbf0e54b51c640f6e3ea9b09f6909.jpg"></div><br>  Inside the lamp is a massive radiator that provides good cooling of the LED module.  The lamp temperature during operation does not exceed 45 degrees. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2d9/342/1e0/2d93421e04cda6b50cda6bf6e355d8d0.jpg"></div><br>  The dimmable driver is put in place of the regular one and allows you to use lamps in conjunction with brightness controls. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/53e/aed/c7f/53eaedc7f7e407972137ba1e18914e85.jpg"></div><br>  A preliminary version of a dimmable driver came to my test, with the use of which a visible ripple of light appears, the level of which is about 40%.  I contacted the manufacturer and found out that in the new dimmable driver, which will soon be on sale, the pulsations of the light will be minimized. <br><br>  I measured the parameters of luminaires with standard drivers.  Luminous flux, lighting angle and consumption characteristics were measured with a Viso Light Spion instrument, power consumption with a Robiton PM-2 instrument, color rendering index, color temperature and pulsation with a Uprtek MK350D instrument.  The minimum operating voltage at which the luminous flux decreased by no more than 10% of the nominal was measured using a Lamptest device.  Before measurements to stabilize the parameters of the lamps warmed up for half an hour. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f17/b54/001/f17b54001fffd65976bef494666d30f0.png"></div><br>  Luminous flux was more than the stated.  VILLY gives approximately the same amount of light as a 100 watt incandescent lamp. <br><br>  The color rendering index (CRI, Ra) is about 83, which allows the use of lamps in residential areas. <br><br>  Light pulsation with the standard driver is practically absent.  Luminaires can operate at a greatly reduced voltage (up to 90 V) without reducing the brightness.  With switches that have an indicator, the lights do not work (they flash when the switch is off).  This problem can be solved by installing the Granite block BZ-300-L parallel to the luminaire. <br><br>  Spectrum measurement protocols, CRI, pulsations. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/778/302/e81/778302e81396e2404ca64d3e8edf6e62.jpg"></div><br>  The illumination angle is about 60 degrees, as stated. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/763/c1c/413/763c1c413ae0a57498b128551bdb50b8.png"></div><br>  The base of the VILLY lamp costs 2417 rubles, various fixtures - from 1000 to 1667 rubles, additional deflectors for 167 rubles. <br><br>  Video version of the review: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vKNC6iWl8uE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  VILLY luminaires are an interesting and versatile solution.  Based on a set of four luminaire base options, five interchangeable deflectors and six mounting options, you can assemble almost a hundred “different” luminaires for different applications. <br><br>  Luminaires with a standard driver provide high-quality light without pulsation with a sufficiently high color rendering index. <br><br>  © 2018, Alexey Nadyozhin </div>
