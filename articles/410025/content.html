<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, Giktayms!  It is fashionable to discuss computer hardware again - though not in a romantic way “what technology has reached”, but in the discipline “miners against gamers in the fight for video cards”.  But today we will not be commonplace, because we will tell on the example of Kingston and HyperX about what RAM and what drives will be on sale in 2018. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/iz/de/39/izde39ui71rfhpu2urxto-og2ka.jpeg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8000c">Kingston DCP1000 and DCU1000 - SSD server, monstrous</font> </h2><br>  No one is surprised by the technologies that arrive in peaceful operation from the defense industry, as well as the racing know-how in "civilian" cars.  And in the computer industry, if you wanted to know "where the bullets are coming from" innovations for mainstream computers, you need to look at corporate-grade hardware.  And this iron from Kingston in 2018 looks like this: <br><br><h3>  The company's flagship storage - SSD Kingston DCP1000 </h3><br>  His service, you see, is dangerous and difficult, and, at first glance, as if it is not visible - when a file from the cloud arrives on the laptop faster than before, users sing a laudatory song to the ISP.  When the website opens more quickly, the compliments also fall to the browser.  Corporate SSDs do not hear praise in their address, but simply work in a harsh way - faster and more stable than the most motivated employees.  And one of the fastest drives in this class is the Kingston DCP1000. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ag/5w/nd/ag5wndejf1blx7fpcmukmlji7c0.jpeg"><br>  <i>Kingston DCP1000</i> <br><br>  By design, this is not a standalone SSD, but a “combo” of four flagship NVMe drives in M.2 form factor under the roof <s>of your</s> Broadcom PEX 8725 switch house. With this set, the DCP1000 is able to work even in high-speed PCIe 3.0 x8 frames, squeezes over a million IOPS and transfers data at speeds up to 7 GB / s. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JLAk3IIR9Q4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>And here is a vivid video about the capabilities of the fastest NVMe drive in the world.</i> <br><br><h3>  Industrial class drive "turnkey" - DCU1000 </h3><br>  This is a <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/281088/">PCIe NVMe U.2</a> standard SSD, but already “combat ready” in order to equip them with all 10 compartments of a single-unit server.  In each such drive, four Kingston SSDs are combined with a total volume of up to 3.2 TB.  This configuration is not just more affordable than “I want to be as cool as possible” in the DCP1000, but it also scales well - 10 DCU1000 drives (read 40 drives in the U.2 server) squeeze up to 30 GB / s in read mode and up to 27 GB / s on recording in sequential operations.  And they are processing, it is terrible to say, about 7 million / 6.6 million 4K IOPS with a high queue depth.  And, of course, do not forget about the support of "hot" replacement of such drives in servers U.2! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3q/12/-b/3q12-brfu_wrbdtqxcbzbjbfo2m.png"><br>  <i>Kingston DCU1000</i> <br><br>  It is possible to unleash the potential of DCP1000 and DCU1000 in any load, but the first copies of these drives process high-quality video in 8K RED Raw and 4K EXR 16-bit formats.  Film studios will be pleased. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8000c">Kingston UV500 - SATA-SSD lived, is alive and will live!</font>  <font color="#d8000c">¯ \ _ (ツ) _ / ¯ (now with 3D NAND taste)</font> </h2><br>  In no case are we going to read notations and preach the release of the soul “legacy-phobias”, but reporting to geeks about the release of new SATA-III standard drives is like reporting on the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/278686/">release of a VHS tape recorder in 2016</a> .  Yes, restrictions on the speed of sequential writing, yes, the AHCI protocol after all the NVMe "charms" already causes a smirk.  But to whom is perfectionism, and to whom is the most affordable, compatible even with older systems, but at the same time modern drives for every day. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/x0/oc/ac/x0ocacyykhfkpov28pepb4kkdxg.jpeg"><br>  <i>Kingston UV500</i> <br><br>  Such a drive in the “red head” portfolio in 2018 is the brand new UV500.  And this is not a "restyling" of the current UV400, but a completely new model, for the first time with 3D NAND memory (higher resource, drives are cheaper in terms of GB capacity) in the history of Kingston's budget drives.  The dual-core four-channel Marvell controller is good in terms of performance, and with LDPC error correction it reduces the wear on already very reliable memory chips. <br>  The “people's” drive should be universal, so the UV500 can be bought in the classic 2.5 form factor, in the “monument of the transitional era of drives” mSATA, and as a modern module M.2. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8000c">Kingston A1000 - PCI-E NVMe for the price of low-cost SATA drives</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hh/q_/yy/hhq_yyczj5ecpuvncedypfsp_v0.jpeg"><br><br>  Every new SATA 6 Gb / s standard drive is a budget drive.  But this does not mean that every budget drive should be limited to an outdated interface.  Therefore, Kingston built A1000 - available M.2 2280 format drives with 3D NAND memory and NVMe 1.3 protocol support.  And such (speed + format) combination is still rarely found in budget drives. <br><br>  As a result, we get drives with a capacity of 240/480/960 GB with sequential read / write speeds of about 1650/1050 MB / s - this is more than 2 times faster than SATA-SSD can offer.  At the price level of the same SATA competitors in terms of $ 1 / GB. <br>  Retail prices will come up a little later, but be sure they will pleasantly surprise you. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8000c">The world's first RAM with infrared sync backlight and SSD with RGB illumination</font> </h2><br>  Predator DDR4 memory is the fastest and most efficient among all the varieties of Kingston / HyperX RAM.  And now to the hardcore added "decor" - the world's first synchronization of illumination based on infrared radiation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fy/qu/m1/fyqum15uhk9fxm9bsd-omww9lva.jpeg"><br><br>  With such sensors you can adjust the backlight in a steep housing, even on unsuitable for "styling" matplata.  However, the popular systems for controlling RGB illumination (ASUS Aura Sync, Gigabyte RGB Fusion and MSI Mystic Light Sync) also support the new DDR4 Predator. <br><br>  The modules will come in retail in the second half of 2018 - specifications and retail price will be announced closer to the official launch on sale. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8000c">And finally, the gaming SSD HyperX Fury with RGB-backlit.</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xx/hw/6g/xxhw6gvdnjzlq7qmw1nbtqhwx04.jpeg"><br><br>  A pleasant trifle for those who design cool illumination in a computer, but do not want to “collective farm” the illumination using non-standard methods.  An SATA-III interface is used to connect to the system.  Speed: 550 MB / s read and 520 MB / s write. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wc/hi/v9/wchiv9bzv7vh52xs6gatqf6sgk8.jpeg"><br><br>  Subscribe and stay with us - it will be interesting! <br><br>  For more information about Kingston and HyperX products, visit <a href="https://goo.gl/RUKonh">the company's</a> official <a href="https://goo.gl/RUKonh">website</a> . <br><br><hr>  By the way, <a href="http://hyperx.gg/GeektimesEliteRPG">sales of the</a> new HyperX Alloy Elite RGB keyboard <a href="http://hyperx.gg/GeektimesEliteRPG">started</a> .
