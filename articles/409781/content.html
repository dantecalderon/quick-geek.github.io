<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In pursuit of environmental friendliness of materials and lowering their cost, automakers use soy, straw, oil cake, obtained from palm oil extraction and other components that are “tasty” for rats and mice, which is why rodents start up in the car and live under the hood and in the cabin.  In the US, claims against Kia, Toyota, Honda and Hyundai have already been filed.  It all started in the 1990s with Mercedes-Benz with biodegradable wire insulation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wn/f6/7w/wnf67w1rsmqsqe5sve5w2fk-cj4.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Rats did not eat cars because they used only metal, glass and plastic made from petroleum.  In the mid-1980s, in Germany and then throughout Europe, they began to think about <a href="http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/JOM/0308/Kanari-0308.html">ecology, emissions and car recycling</a> , which is why they decided to hold car concerns responsible for their product “from cradle to grave”.  Politicians forced manufacturers to think about how to disassemble and recycle it after a car was out of service. <br><br>  In the early 1990s, Daimler <a href="https://topgearrussia.ru/news/6513_Kryisha_u_obochinyi_i_odnorazovyie_provoda">began</a> using biodegradable plastic in Mercedes-Benz to isolate wires.  Such materials in isolation were used from 1991 to 1995.  But the aggressive environment inside the car led to the fact that for several years there was practically nothing left of isolation, and for this, no pests were needed.  The wires became unusable soon after the end of the warranty on the car - for 5-7 years from the date of purchase, and 12 years later all car owners had to change the wiring.  This pleasure cost up to $ 6 thousand for one car. <br><br>  Today, component manufacturers are replacing any durable metal components with plastic with a limited service life.  Soy is used in materials for many components from insulating wires to foam in the seats. <br><br>  Honda actually sells a special tape against rodents.  You buy a car in a complete set, pay for insurance, then take such tape and wind it with each wire to avoid short circuits.  This applies not only Honda, but also Hyundai, Toyota and Kia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nw/ol/ix/nwolixguz_6x1tnuceqthsmfppg.jpeg"><br><br>  If you have not done so, the rats and rabbits will quickly cope with the wiring and start living in the cabin, as <a href="https://www.carcomplaints.com/news/2017/toyota-soy-wiring-class-action-lawsuit.shtml">was the case</a> with the 2012 Toyota Sequoia car bought by Mr. Roscoe in Massachusetts in 2015.  In May 2016, during a trip over the leg of his wife, a mouse began to run, and a little later, when she was sitting in the passenger seat, the mouse climbed onto her shoulder. <br><br>  The buyer paid $ 37,884 for the car and $ 1,250 for her warranty, so she went to an authorized service center.  But the warranty did not make repairs, because the damage "occurred due to external reasons."  I had to pay the insurance company.  The cost of repair was $ 16,700 - almost half the price of the car.  Roscoe asked not to use soy wires anymore, but his request was ignored. <br><br>  As a result, Roscoe acted as one of the plaintiffs against Toyota along with other car owners 4Runner, Avalon, Camry, Corolla, Highlander, FJ Cruiser, Prius, Rav4, Sienna, Tundra and others.  In 2017 in California, similar claims were filed against South Korean <a href="https://www.carcomplaints.com/news/2017/hyundai-soy-based-wiring-lawsuit-rodents.shtml">Hyundai</a> and <a href="https://www.carcomplaints.com/news/2017/kia-soy-based-wiring-chewed-rodents-lawsuit.shtml">Kia</a> .  This seems especially amusing after using Kia hamsters in advertising.  Rats, squirrels and rabbits ate wires and some hoses inside the car. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BNYzrmdzktk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Automakers periodically loudly declare concern for the environment.  Concern Volkswagen <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/263012/">forged the results of tests</a> on the exhaust of two-liter diesel engines, reducing the results dozens of times.  Other concerns, referring to the environmental friendliness of materials, reduce the cost of their production. <br><br>  Among the cars that rodents liked very much were the Porsche 928S of 1983, the Acura Legend of 1990, all Honda models from 2009 to 2013 - more than 100 incidents a year, American Ford 2010–2013 - rodents picked their seats, as well as Toyota and 2012 Mercedes-Benz ML 350 4Matic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ccb/cf8/469/ccbcf84695cba08c89ae7a415fe67fee.jpg" align="right" alt="image">  “Eco-friendly” materials that <a href="http://www.synlube.com/IncredibleEdibleCar1.htm">rodents find particularly tasty</a> are used in wire insulation, in seats, in carpeting, in plastic details of a car's interior.  The materials include: <br><br><ul><li>  Soy </li><li>  Rice hulls </li><li>  Tree </li><li>  Cake from palm oil </li><li>  Straw </li></ul><br>  The rats, of course, had eaten the wire before, but not with such appetite.  Now, with the use of “environmentally friendly” materials, such cases have become so widespread that the manufacturers themselves understand this and write down the buyer's responsibility for the insulation condition in the instructions.  When buying a Honda or Toyota car, its owner signs a corresponding agreement and undertakes to use pest control products, for example, electrical tape from rodents. </div>
