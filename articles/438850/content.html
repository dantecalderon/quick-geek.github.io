In the report, I will tell how in Avito we developed several tools that helped overcome the routine and made setting up a new project, as well as supporting existing ones, as simple as possible. <br><br clear="left"></p><br><h3 id="obzor-formatov-szhatiya-protokolnogo-urovnya-v-http-mihail-busyrev-crazy-panda">  An overview of the protocol compression formats in http.

Cucumber is a technology with a number of important advantages.  I'll tell you about the essence of the technology, share my experience with it and propose a specific approach that will help not to go into the wilds. <br><br clear="left"></p><br><p>  * The program of the meeting can be changed and supplemented. </p><br><h1 id="paroli-i-yavki">  Passwords and attendances </h1><br><p>  Participation in the event is free, <a href="http://bit.ly/2SBIQMm">registration is required</a> . <br>  Reports will begin at 19:15, registration - at 18:45. <br>  Address: Moscow, Avito company office, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/AbeQA3zyLC62">Lesnaya 7</a> . <br>  The event will be broadcast on our youtube-channel <a href="http://bit.ly/2t7sI73">AvitoTech</a> . </p><br><p>  See you! </p><br><p>  <strong>UPD:</strong> Registration is completed, the places are over. </p></div>
