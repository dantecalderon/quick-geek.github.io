<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I recently <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/lamptest/blog/294783/">talked</a> about a Philips 7W LED lamp purchased from a Dixie store.  The lamp is good, but there was one oddity - the color rendering index (CRI, Ra) was actually above 80, and only 70 are indicated on the manufacturer’s website. I assumed that such lamps from different batches may have different CRIs and this was confirmed by lamps bought at Pyaterochka . <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b4d/7bf/1d6/b4d7bf1d676060d394e67e218da217eb.jpg"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Lamps of 5, 7, and 9 W are sold for 79, 89, and 99 rubles, respectively. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/607/7cd/fe7/6077cdfe7f885dae08eabb1be3310d86.jpg"></div><br>  I measured the parameters of these lamps.  Luminous flux, lighting angle and consumption characteristics were measured with a Viso Light Spion instrument, power consumption with a <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/lamptest/blog/274246/">Robiton PM-2</a> instrument, color rendering index, color temperature and pulsation with a <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/lamptest/blog/282344/">Uprtek MK350D instrument</a> .  The minimum operating voltage, at which the luminous flux decreased by no more than 10% of the nominal, was measured using a <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/lamptest/blog/286276/">Lamptest-1</a> device, Stable Stab Instab <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/lamptest/blog/285480/">500</a> , LATP Suntek TDGC2-0.5 and an <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/lamptest/blog/286134/">Aneng AN8001 multimeter</a> .  Before measurements to stabilize the parameters of the lamp heated for half an hour. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/49a/f32/dfb/49af32dfb7d49aeb90e71dfd77a9a44a.png"></div><br><br>  For all the lamps, the actual power turned out to be less than the declared one, while the luminous flux (the amount of light that the lamp gives) is 6-13% higher than the declared.  It's good.  The first lamp shines as brightly as a 70-watt incandescent lamp, the second, as a 60-watt, third, as a 40-watt. <br><br>  There is practically no ripple - this is also good. <br><br>  Lamps can operate without dimming at reduced mains voltage (up to 88-118 V), so they can also be used where the mains voltage is unstable. <br><br>  With a switch that has an indicator, the lamps do not work correctly - they glow dimly when they are turned off. <br><br>  The CRI for the 7 and 9 W lamps was low - 75, and for the 5-watt lamp - 83. <br><br>  I compared a 7-watt lamp from Dixie (on the left) and from Pyaterochka. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/604/062/edd/604062edde55624c8ef724a1f1b633aa.jpg"></div><br>  The boxes for the lamps are exactly the same, the barcodes are the same, but the codes indicated on the lamp bases are different - 9290012044A for a high CRI lamp and 9290012044B1 for a low CRI lamp.  In addition, between the “Made in China” and the release date code, the lamps have different symbols drawn — the first “square on the leg” and the second “arrow”.  I guess so Philips codes the plants that produce the lamps.  The date of manufacture of the lamp from Dixie - May 2017, the lamp from Pyaterochka - June 2017. <br><br>  Let's look at three lamps from Pyaterochka. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7df/d09/151/7dfd09151da3fca769d14d5ba314c7ac.jpg"></div><br>  All the same - with lamps with CRI 75 "arrow" and at the end of the code "B1", at the lamp with CRI 83 "square" and at the end of the code "A".  All three lamps are made in June 2017. <br><br>  The parameters of the Philips economy lamp LED lamps correspond to the data given by the manufacturer on the lamp box and on the website.  There are two versions of these lamps - with color rendering indices 75 and 83. Apparently, lamps with CRI 75 are marked with “B1” at the end of the code printed on the base of the lamp, and lamps with CRI 83 are marked with “A” at the end of the code on the base . <br><br>  PS The same lamps are sold in FixPrice.  I looked at it, all “B1”, that is, with a lower CRI.  They are the same, but twice as expensive are sold in stores Okay and there, too, B1.  Perhaps “A” is nowhere to be found. <br><br>  © 2018, Alexey Nadyozhin </div>
