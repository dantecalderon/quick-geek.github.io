Site visitors register for webinars via the online plugin form.  The appearance of the plugin can be customized through templates (Javascript and HTML).

And visitors to your site can register, receive reminders and connect to the event from anywhere in the world.  However, you can offer certain webinars only to pre-registered users of the site.  The organizer can also track the registration of participants in the “Schedule a Conference” section of the 3CX web client. <br><br><h2>  Benefits of 3CX WebMeeting for webinars </h2><br>  Video conferencing and webinars have proven to be an e-learning tool.

It is enough to create a webinar in the 3CX v16 Pro web client and information about it will immediately appear on your website.  The built-in recording of conferences further increases the value of the solution, allowing you to go back to past webinars and archive them for future use. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1dc/552/f74/1dc552f741879ba078771f155e9b1f82.png"><br><br><h2>  Install and configure the plugin </h2><br>  To install the plugin, go to the CMS WordPress management interface and go to <b>Plugins&gt; Add New</b> .
