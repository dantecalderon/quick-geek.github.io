<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Microsoft wants to warn users about unreliable news sources using a new feature in its Edge browser on mobile devices. <br><br>  In an expansion of the NewsGuard partnership, alerts began to appear in some news stories on the Edge mobile browser about the reliability of the source.  The Guardian reported that The Daily Mail was flagged with a warning: â€œthis website, as a rule, does not support basic standards of accuracy and accountability. <br><br>  NewsGuard has been available on the Edge since last August, but only as an extra plug-in.  At the moment, the service is built into the browser itself, but is only available in the mobile version. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  News Guard was founded by journalists Stephen Brill and Gordon Blood.  He evaluates news sites on nine different criteria, including how simple they are in terms of property and advertising, and how often they publish false or deceptive content. <br><br>  The Microsoft Edge Browser is not widely used, but adding additional protection against potential fake news and other unreliable materials may give it an advantage.  While Microsoft went against bots and artificial intelligence, the company has a goal to put ethics in the first place, at least, to try to protect technology from dishonest intentions. </div>
