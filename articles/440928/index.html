For example, the rigidity of the walls of large arteries increases during life and largely determines the risk of death from cardiovascular diseases [ <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10679510">1</a> ].  Therefore, they learned how to determine it: for example, through pulse pressure [ <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9403561">2</a> ] or telomere length [ <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11230304">3</a> ].  Heart rate variability (HRV) reflects both cognitive and athletic abilities of the body: how quickly a person solves problems, how much he can run and squeeze in the hall, how quickly he recovers after exercise [ <a href="https://academic.oup.com/abm/article-abstract/37/2/141/4565855">4</a> ].  With age, this figure falls [ <a href="http://www.onlinejacc.org/content/31/3/593.abstract">5</a> , <a href="http://www.onlinejacc.org/content/37/1/153.abstract">6</a> , <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature23018%3Fsf97304117">7</a> ]. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Medicine has long used the chronological age to assess health-related risks: doctors adjust the clinical examination plan depending on the year of birth of the patient and pay attention to the early symptoms of age-related problems.  Knowing your bio-age is the first step to lowering it. <br><br><h4>  Methods for determining bio-age </h4><br>  The most famous example is bio-age, created by Steve Horvath, known as Horvat‚Äôs epigenetic clock [ <a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2013-14-10-r115">8</a> ]: it is considered according to DNA methylation patterns (methylation is a reversible genome modification that increases or decreases gene expression depending on the needs and abilities of the organism).  Other methods for determining bio-age are based on data from blood tests [ <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17921421">9</a> ], proteome [ <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep17282">10</a> ], or even 3D facial images [ <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201536">11</a> ]. <br><br>  Some time ago, the Russian company Gero discovered that bio-age can be determined by analyzing human locomotor activity [ <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23534-9">12</a> ] - changes in the intensity of walking during the day: for example, in old and sick people, the periods of activity are much shorter [ <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6224248/">13</a> ].  Now a new scientific article is being prepared for publication, in which the company's researchers tell how they managed to simplify the models even more, almost without losing accuracy: it turned out that bio-age can be determined according to a questionnaire in which a person is asked about the current state of health and well-being. . <br><br>  This method in Gero was discovered during the analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database.  NHANES is a study that was conducted in the United States in 1999-2010.  NHANES specialists surveyed 30,000 people aged from 20 to 85 years, that is, for almost the entire lifespan of a person, therefore these data were well suited for creating a bio-age model.  NHANES reduced the long list of questions, leaving only those that reflect the current state of health and at the same time make a significant contribution to the prediction of bio-age.  A person is asked to tell how well he has felt in the last 30 days.  The questions are related to three aspects: physical health, mental state and healthy lifestyle.  The responses of 30,000 respondents ‚Äúfed‚Äù the neural network and trained it to determine health risks depending on the questionnaire data using the classical risk model for such tasks (Cox proportional hazards method). <br><br>  Surprisingly, such a simple and cheap source of data as a subjective assessment of one‚Äôs health by respondents (what is called self-reported in English) makes it possible to create a model that is almost as accurate as a model built on more objective data: indicators of blood or DNA analyzes methylation. <br><br><h4>  Experiment Gero and Open Longevity </h4><br>  While the article is being prepared for publication, Gero decided to test how bio-age responds to the effect of typical biohacker interventions (fasting mimicking diet, metformin and others) on data from living people, and not from "lifeless" datasets.  Ten years ago, when NHANES collected this data, almost no one used supplements to prolong and improve life, so there is very little information in the database.  Those scant data that could be found do not allow to reliably estimate the effect of dietary supplements on bio-age.  Therefore, Gero and Open Longevity launched a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScaYE7TuP8B9Wdx98BASlpOzmgdsMG6iEd6SPcejUWLj4lK_A/viewform%3Fentry.1604127303%3DHabr.com">survey</a> to gather more information and find out how the intake of specific drugs affects their health. <br><br>  <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScaYE7TuP8B9Wdx98BASlpOzmgdsMG6iEd6SPcejUWLj4lK_A/viewform%3Fentry.1604127303%3DHabr.com">The survey</a> has already gained more than 1000 participants and showed the first interesting findings: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6r/ol/id/6rolidoscvua3tka5-_vue4q8ka.png"><br><br>  More than a third of the participants practice some form of calorie restriction. <br><br>  And when they compared the health scores in the group of Russians and the group of English-speaking respondents, it turned out that many more people feel excellent abroad: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8z/s_/hl/8zs_hl08g0xh4gicyh9fgxmxpxg.png"><br><br>  But for really interesting results you need a lot more data.
