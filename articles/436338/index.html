  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How does Vnukovo airport work</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Vnukovo was launched on July 2, 1941, the project was supervised by K. Ye. Voroshilov.  We wanted to be in time by August 18 - the Day of the Air Fleet of the USSR.  But the war began on June 22, so I had to run faster, repaint the hull from white to black and green.  The Moscow special-purpose air group (MAGON) made 60 thousand sorties to the front line and to the rear of the enemy.  The Germans did not touch the runway themselves (it seems they expected to use it during the seizure), but they bombed the building and fuel depots, anti-aircraft installations nearby. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wi/kp/pp/wikpppvpogj0f9fpv7tpvmg_y9k.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  The airport is in the city, so the subway will lead to it.  The project of the new terminal, oddly enough, is German.  It was originally designed for the convenience of passengers in the first place, so he has a rather unusual usability. <br><br>  Here goes a two-story aeroexpress.  This is the first airport that introduced silence in Russia: announcements are only critical, all flights in succession are not credited. <br><br>  But let's start gradually. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  How do people get to the airport </h3><br>  Since Vnukovo is in the city, it can be reached by bus (stops at an underground pedestrian crossing that leads to terminal A building), by aeroexpress (arrives at a unique underground station located directly in the passenger terminal) and by car (including free to drop car-sharing car at a special parking lot). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tc/sx/9r/tcsx9rsppfffnovlietqcndx5d0.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  From the subway by bus to get about 15-20 minutes.  By express train from Kievsky Station - 35 minutes.  Kiev highway for cars is fairly free (in comparison with other free roads to airports, but, of course, not during peak hours), you can also get to Vnukovo airport via three more multi-speed highways: Borovsky, Minsk and Kaluzhsky. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qo/rh/8_/qorh8_aozmiydkz3vsbjhacdsuw.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>The tunnel connects the airport building, Aeroexpress and Hilton.</i>  <i>In the transition, robots speak in a voice before the departure of the next train.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pv/-s/oe/pv-soecwn3nawkgklv_anl9vrgu.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Like the entire airport, it is cleaned constantly: 7/24/365.</i>  <i>Special services monitor the quality of cleaning and climate.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ns/oo/ap/nsooap92nmdat_g6p-uskps0nuw.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>At the exit from the tunnel, the first traces of what the architect thought well begin: here these luminaires diffuse the electric light and reflect the daytime onto the escalator so that both sources are not blind.</i> <br><br>  The staff of the airport complex is about 16.5 thousand people and lives mainly in the village of Vnukovo and in Peredelkino near, in other nearby residential areas.  The airport is tightly surrounded by residential buildings on three sides.  There is a whole complex of everything you need near the airport: a canteen, a large private hospital with a hospital, a lot of offices.  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/tuturu/blog/431198/">Dispatchers</a> monitor the movement of aircraft on the platform and in the sky, they sit generally apart from the airport, in the tower on the airfield. <br><br>  Opposite the airport there is a hotel, which also leads an underground passage.  The main entrance to the Hilton is located opposite Terminal A, where all passenger flights are served on arrival and departure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hh/tz/7h/hhtz7hiygwnf6nal2zekbxmpooo.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Prices are quite normal given that this is still a 4-star Hilton: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ej/cp/sb/ejcpsbqhcx8juotydmvlmuqurgg.png"><br>  <i>At Petrovka hotel of this class is usually 10 times more expensive.</i> <br><br>  And in the next building Rospotrebnadzor sits, therefore there were no stocks of hygiene or some kind of abnormal food in Vnukovo. <br><br>  At the station square of Vnukovo Airport, there are two multi-storey car parks for 350 cars each, as well as an area adjacent to the car parks, which can accommodate 200 more cars.  Parking time is unlimited.  At the station square Vnukovo airport, you can call for free for 15 minutes.  One of the big problems of the airport is seeing off, dropping cars right on the road.  Therefore, the airport agreed with the city that evacuators drive there very often so that there are no traffic jams. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ds/n9/zp/dsn9zpmuqzkbgbuit5j665r4n2o.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>These taxi drivers violate the parking rules.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lf/l1/t3/lfl1t3cucivxeu2gvsbmaoh6n6s.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Airport building.</i>  <i>The overpass is no longer the airport, and the transition road is also the territory of the city.</i>  <i>Trolleys for luggage can be taken immediately under the overpass.</i> <br><br>  Comfortable conditions of stay at the airport begin at the entrance to the airport.  The mere separation of the flows entering and leaving already seriously eliminates the airport from the crush. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pg/5v/hg/pg5vhg26dn6kmhz9jdsdheya7io.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>The columns are numbered for the convenience of calling a taxi.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zc/ij/cp/zcijcp2exhutsq4vbdnqenhscjm.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Vnukovo has already been registered in the city's plan for expanding the metro, here in three years a yellow line station will appear: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zh/ry/7u/zhry7ult-vboatnjmjjn3zqhkhs.png" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  We go to the airport </h3><br>  Terminal A Vnukovo - the largest in size in the Russian Federation: 270 thousand square meters.  m (for example, the terminal B Sheremetyevo - only 110 thousand square meters. m). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uk/eb/nx/ukebnxmfoqsfqwipeqanrgpy62m.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  The first thing we see inside is a unique ceiling.  The ‚Äúdome‚Äù is made for a reason: this is to maximize the use of light. <br><br>  The second feature is the location of check-in counters.  They are placed diagonally by the clusters, which allowed them to fit more than they did in a normal arrangement, on the one hand, and on the other, they were given the opportunity to see where they were.  Since the racks are made in abundance and a separate block is allocated for each airline, there are very few queues. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cb/-b/zf/cb-bzfhanozyrnhdexu6hyl31jw.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>View of the "dome".</i>  <i>Sets the tree "machine-mantis."</i>  <i>She also washed facades.</i> <br><br>  Opposite the entrance there is a board and a stand of information, you can immediately turn your head and see your stand.  Domestic flights and international flights are not separated here, so if you see the racks of your airline, you can definitely register there.  From the last: Uzbek Airlines and AZUR air, the largest charter carrier of Russia, appeared in Vnukovo. <br><br>  At each step from check-in to the gate, the board and arrows that lead the passenger will come across: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zf/7g/re/zf7gre_sjfnpoxhv9_ytffuuhlq.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tw/r6/uz/twr6uzksj7__vlwvjal4bz6wv5u.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  They are in three languages ‚Äã‚Äã(Russian, English and Chinese), voice in two languages ‚Äã‚Äã(Russian and English).  But the airport itself was designed for flows of both Russian and foreign citizens, so getting lost in it is almost impossible.  The entire route (user scenario) is built so that all the time you have to go forward by default.  Although, of course, with tourists on the flight happens all.  But even during the Championship there were no problems with any group of people who did not even speak the three main languages. <br><br>  Here at this terminal you can show the boarding pass from the phone and get it from the printer: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nk/fl/to/nkfltofigun1rvyeaqccx7pfcwo.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  This is very convenient if you have already checked in for the flight, but do not want to go to the counter (this is when you do not have baggage): you can come up, get a boarding ticket and go straight to the ‚Äúclean‚Äù zone right behind this column. <br><br>  By the way, pay attention to one more solution - there are no chairs on the floor of the registration area, they are located on the third floor of the terminal for those who have to wait or change for a long time. <br><br>  By the way, while you walked through the ‚Äúdirty‚Äù zone, you have already been checked for hazardous substances, but you most likely do not know about it.  The dog service Vnukovo is one of the coolest in Russia (because in fact there are two dog services on the territory at once: aviation security and a linear internal affairs department).  Increased safety is due to the fact that next to it is Vnukovo-2, from where the first persons fly.  The FSB and FSO are already in place, the service does not need to go out of the city, if that. <br><br>  Here is an employee sniffed you: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5n/da/qn/5ndaqndyjntel4aow2qlyknybek.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Dogs do not smell explosives like we do.  Roughly speaking, we sense smells as one signal, and dogs are able to separate them along carriers.  Therefore, if you wrap something dangerous in drugs, then you smear it with epoxy, and then add coffee and creosote on top, the dog will think: ‚ÄúFu, what an abomination: he took creosote, smeared it with epoxy, which contains drugs, and in the middle - explosives! <br><br>  In fact, of course, she does not think, but just bark. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2b/5b/am/2b5bam6ykkmtzjzz3mqxynaf_5u.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>At restaurants at the airport accounted for an insane amount of checks.</i>  <i>Because of the size of the building, it needs its own fire service, it checks the restaurants before the Emergencies Ministry.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  There are also different shops at the entrance and exit.  They are selected according to special regulations in order to be useful to passengers.  On departure - cafe, food, pharmacy, newspapers, toys.  On arrival - flowers, grocery, press, mobile operators. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ls/xj/ra/lsxjral-cxdtj9e2u_hre2y4tzi.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Again, do not rush to go to the "clean" zone, as long as you have time before departure.  That's why. <br><br>  On the third floor are usually held interesting exhibitions: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5o/km/kw/5okmkw4g_lznqky5qm-79erutn0.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  And it looks like information boards from afar, but in reality it is a historical exhibition with interesting facts about the border service and archival photos: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rt/kk/yz/rtkkyzc1irslbsosckejkd0ikmy.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  There is a kids club: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/f-/3x/8s/f-3x8sareu6ykstc08-i2z-glmg.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  There is a cinema with individual booths for watching movies (small booths with movies for three people): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qz/v7/np/qzv7nprgh7xfe48lg9ytjhaaznu.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  By the way, you can sit there before departure: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uw/nz/7b/uwnz7baxdthhkc_f0kmsjtuln9o.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  They cost 250 rubles.  an hour just to sit, and from 400 rubles - with a movie.  But now you can lie down, because there is a capsule hotel right next to it: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lf/bl/yv/lfblyvi2_wxmvot6kohn74t-o2o.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ps/kh/ur/pskhur3pmpfgsutfoaybuahllna.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ln/qe/hi/lnqehis2y2fshsrn6mntdwyctku.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9e/my/3b/9emy3b63dwb2mb2shq3f32hm9le.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  The hotel costs 350 rubles per hour. <br><br>  Taxfree appeared on the departure recently - it is important for foreign guests.  Taxfree office is located in the customs area right behind the check-in counters. <br><br>  Also at the airport there is a special children's room: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jm/0a/4h/jm0a4h6hslkzb7l87soyatmhjfw.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, if you are not very well - round the clock health center.  Fundamentally, the operation of these units is not very different from the work of similar units <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/tuturu/blog/426779/">at the station</a> . <br><br>  Vnukovo is one of the country's best mobile passenger service units.  By the way, they provide training for employees of other organizations.  Zhukovsky's staff practiced just here.  You can call the service immediately from the transport, there will be met with a wheelchair.  The services that mobile passengers can get for free at Vnukovo airport include a meeting of a small mobile with transport;  the provision of a wheelchair for traveling around the terminal and for boarding an aircraft;  a specially equipped waiting area next to the support for passengers with limited mobility (Terminal A, departure lounge, left side) and delivery on board the aircraft using an ambulatory elevator or ambulance ambulance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/69/az/wd/69azwdp2td4ehycxxxn2umqsgk8.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  This applies not only to the disabled, but also to the wounded and the sick.  The only thing is that the service is ordered in advance, because the service must plan its time and resources, and the airline must understand the condition of the passenger in advance.  If not notified, the airline has the right to refuse.  Usually a notification is made when purchasing a ticket. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jf/ak/zg/jfakzgb3g0g5yun7q3_ytyxcglq.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the area there is a legislative act about the fact that you can not sit on the floor and ride on animals.  But Vnukovo is an airport located in the city, therefore it is the only airport where you can ride animals for your pleasure.  And sit on the floor.  But the homeless, <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/tuturu/blog/371483/">scourges of modern airports</a> , are not here, because there are a lot of open spaces, almost no back streets.  Occasionally, the homeless can be caught in the transition, but even there they are almost there. <br><br>  Soon there will be more self-service terminals - there are already more of them in recent years. <br><br><h3>  "Clean" zone </h3><br>  Next - the standard inspection and access gates.  There is a VIP-room.  When you go there, the girl in the meeting remembers you in person (they have an inhuman memory for faces) and asks for your ticket.  When it comes time to go to the landing, the employee finds you in the hall and invites you to land directly to this passage.  This is if the domestic flight.  If international - through the standard route. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rk/kr/1y/rkkr1y0nnkcruu85chau6utlani.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  The window shows almost at the very beginning of the ‚Äúclean‚Äù zone a mobile diesel generator: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/w1/v1/o-/w1v1o-uvfm1ejwwkxgtr3ucxlry.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  The airport receives power from the city, but it has its own diesel stationary station and mobile generators (several pieces).  Here is one of them.  In recent years, there have been no food incidents, but exercises and checks are carried out regularly. <br>  Travolators through the entire landing gallery of the departure area: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mv/ph/di/mvphdityujptjd3k6zet6z1d1gw.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  At the end of the hall you can look at the main passage of the aircraft and the prestart: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/57/q6/pa/57q6pad_xwlh7zlmaupzyjua_fs.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>At the airport - two intersecting runways, allowing the airport to change the course of takeoff and landing, depending on the direction of the wind.</i> <br><br>  And in the middle - as aircraft lead to the platform: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k8/i9/f5/k8i9f5jgtlmw36h9tzzcxo0cnsu.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  In a drop - 32 gates.  Special teletrap suitable for Airbus A380.  Dreamliners are already flying here, in particular, the Uzbek airlines have them.  Victory takes a new fleet, there will also be new large aircraft. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-w/qo/ae/-wqoaek7j2asoqrzqicc9fexpsc.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Some gates are intended for boarding the aircraft using a bus.  This is done for those airlines that base their planes in distant parking areas, for example, low-cost companies.  So know: if you arrive at the airport, and you are landed directly into the building, this means that the airline paid the airport for your convenience and rented the exit.  In Vnukovo, gate replacement is a rather rare phenomenon (the runway changes more often): it is well known in advance which gate will fit to which gate. <br><br>  A couple of weeks ago, the 20-millionth passenger flew out, and by the end of the year Vnukovo will serve 21.4 million passengers. <br><br>  From todo: literally recently, for the Championship, a system of ‚Äúsoft‚Äù separation of fans of different teams was introduced (so as not to meet), and skirmishes were practiced.  The second feature - check-in for the flight in 40 minutes closes the car, not the person.  A person can still be in time, if he is dragged by a business class car.  Therefore, a plan is currently being considered for those who are late: it is possible, if they did not have time to register, but the plane has not yet flown, then it will be possible to go through an accelerated procedure.  But it is not yet clear. <br><br>  Despite the proximity to the city, birds and animals in the areas adjacent to the airfield are seen.  The Ornithological Service works with goshawks and falcons.  But the main means of scaring are bioacoustic installations, columns with loudspeakers with the sound of birds of prey.  There was a feature with them: it turns out that our birds are incompatible with the standard sounds of the library (by default, in general, the angry cry of a bald eagle).  Ornithologists climbed forests and recorded birds of prey to pick up birds from the region.  In the end, after a long fit found. <br><br>  And also Vnukovo - Airport of the Year.  To become the best airport, it is necessary to ensure the comfort of the passenger, pass all checks, provide basic services to passengers, and services - to work without interruption and have a minimum of complaints.  Therefore, in Vnukovo very closely monitor the feedback and the practice of international airports.  Social networks are monitored: for example, each constructive mention is dealt with on a weekly plan for revisions and is issued to the service in the form of a ticket. <br><br><h3>  Links </h3><br><ul><li>  If suddenly you find a bug, then here's the quality control service mail - feedback@vnukovo.ru, the most effective way to write there. </li><li>  <a href="http://partners.vnukovo.ru/airport-advantages/technical-characteristics/">Airport specifications</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://corp.vnukovo.ru/general-information/development-strategy/aerovockzalnyy-kompleks-i-aerodromnaya-infrastruktura/">Infrastructure</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://corp.vnukovo.ru/general-information/development-strategy/">IT management</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/436338/">https://habr.com/ru/post/436338/</a></p>
