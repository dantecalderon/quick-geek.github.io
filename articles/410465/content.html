<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It's been almost two years since Xindao and its XD Design studio launched the first “anti-theft” backpack, <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/madrobots/blog/282286/">Bobby,</a> on Kickstarter.  The crowdfunding hit had two new versions ( <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/madrobots/blog/289843/">Compact</a> and <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/madrobots/blog/295775/">Bizz</a> ), along with hundreds of imitators who sell fakes under the guise of "the very Bobby".  In such a situation, you need to be proactive and constantly invent something new.  Meet the new backpack from XD Design - Bobby Urban. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qd/br/3s/qdbr3shlcssvru-p8i0qrocidls.jpeg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first thing that catches your eye is the upper part of the backpack twisting into a neat roll.  This design is called rolltop.  It may seem simple enough or even vintage.  It looks like the form of the packs of soldiers of the Napoleonic era - you can remember them from illustrations in history books.  But in reality they consisted of the satchel itself and the folded soft load fastened to it from above — the overcoat.  Modern rolltop has pronounced tourist roots.  Today "rolls" are equipped with urban backpacks, and it looks especially funny in leather: it looks like a paper bag with delicious pastries. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ah/ou/cm/ahoucmdbdabsw8wgt3tk0gnzxqs.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  In a bag of this design it is very convenient to fill different things, because its volume is regulated by folding.  Tightly closed valve provides additional protection against moisture.  However, in XD Design he was given a completely new, security function using a belt with a combination lock. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vp/zv/ua/vpzvua4h8zzdtumzzc7d59qr1ji.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Everything works simply: you close with a zipper and twist the backpack valve, fasten it with a belt - you get a handle. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-t/mq/pi/-tmqpihttdzectdkko6m8fjt_qa.gif" alt="image"></div><br>  Need to leave your Bobby Urban for five minutes unattended?  With the same pen, it fastens securely to a bench, fence or pole. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-x/zk/ue/-xzkuerjuxsbnkcxqnjflr-9jgi.gif" alt="image"></div><br>  Strong anti-cutting fabric of the main compartment will not allow to make another hole in the backpack to bypass the tricky protection.  It is clear that all this is designed for knives and similar improvised tools of the pickpocket, and not for a soldering iron, <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/madrobots/blog/297751/">flamethrower</a> , chainsaw and other exotic things. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ks/xj/ch/ksxjch1hmp1nzdb4r9k_uvrjnu0.gif" alt="image"></div><br>  According to the already established tradition, inside Bobby Urban has pockets and pockets for gadgets and documents, as well as a compartment for a laptop.  There are also pockets for travel on the straps. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wo/_h/du/wo_hdu1vkei8hz273rt5ao3fae0.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is worth noting that all previous versions of Bobby are designed according to the “no-pocket” concept - they do not have external, easily accessible compartments.  Urban is different in that it has a large side pocket for a water bottle and an elastic cord for attaching bulky items to a backpack.  For example, you can fix a helmet or a basketball.  (Apparently, XD Design reasoned that no pickpocket in his right mind would steal bottles). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9l/tr/er/9ltrerx0hxudq6mqzhirpxois1a.gif" alt="image"></div><br>  And, of course, the backpack is not afraid to get wet accidentally.  It is enough to wipe it with a dry cloth, and it will be as good as new. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dq/fi/d9/dqfid9yawsongvcs7b8y_aabbfu.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  So far this is all that is known about Bobby Urban.  But the XD Design news on one backpack does not end, because the studio has prepared as many as two backpacks! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0i/p1/ym/0ip1ym6jqem5as4m21zhkewtea0.jpeg" alt="image"></div><br>  The second is called Bobby XL, and is an enlarged version of the classic Bobby.  Rejoice, lovers of normal, comfortable, large gadgets: laptops with a diagonal of up to 17 "and tablets with a diagonal of up to 10" fit into it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gv/zg/5z/gvzg5zfvsi0wypdbyelar2zrcos.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  At the same time, the difference in dimensions is quite small.  Bobby XL is 3 centimeters higher than the original Bobby (47 vs. 44 centimeters) and 100 grams heavier (950 vs. 850 grams, respectively). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0z/1i/n9/0z1in923qeqrdoseksvmhwrqueo.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  The rest of the qualities that the original "anti-theft" backpack deserved people's love remained unchanged.  Of course, Bobby XL can not be cut with a knife, because it is sewn from a whole "sandwich" of different materials.  Such multi-layer protection is also waterproof. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lo/jc/qx/lojcqxrybhpaubrafdrl2kyd1wy.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  The zipper is not visible, as it is hidden under a thick fold of fabric.  But it opens the backpack for all 180 °, if necessary. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5m/j7/n2/5mj7n29tscbbjinwabj1m8krpf8.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Ergonomic design of the backpack reduces the load on the back.  All things inside the Bobby XL do not hang out, as each is attached to its place, including a bank.  To use it on the go, there is an outgoing USB cable.  Available colors include black and the combination of black and gray. <br><br>  Sales of new Bobby models have not yet begun.  But you can already place a pre-order for <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/xd-design-bobby-urban/">Bobby Urban</a> and <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/xd-design-bobby-xl/">Bobby XL</a> in Madrobots.  Do you have something to say about the "anti-theft" backpacks?  Do you think rolltops are for hipsters who don’t understand anything in human bags?
