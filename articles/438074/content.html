<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  February 9 find out who the coolest tester!  The contour and the Ural Testers UTC community regularly conduct testing sessions.  The point is this: we are going to the crowd and are looking for bugs in the application.  So we tested a startup Yandex.Master, a mobile bank from <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BA_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D0%25BA%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8_%25D0%25B8_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">UBRiR</a> , a <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/skbkontur/blog/350484/">mobile application for organizing a conference</a> and much more. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/53/5x/yb/535xyb23oil1tt0g_t-pk5nc8fw.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  The classic format of a test session involves testing a web service.  The participant has a product analyst.  There are N hours to search for bugs.  At the end of the jury consider who found how many bugs.  The best are prizes.  This time the organizers decided to shake up the format and released two updates.  First, we will test through the code, and secondly, three cities will be participating at once: Ekaterinburg, St. Petersburg and Novosibirsk.  The goals remain the same - to find as many bugs as possible, to communicate with colleagues from other companies, to learn a new approach in work. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fz/pw/um/fzpwumiav-o-gena-rs4zbopzo0.jpeg"><br><br><p>  We will write tests on C # in an existing project.  So knowledge of C # syntax will be a plus, and ignorance - the reason for it to google or watch a course on <a href="https://ulearn.me/">ulearn.me</a> .  At the test session, we are waiting for experienced automators who know what units, asserts and test design are, for example, read the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Practitioners-Guide-Software-Test-Design/dp/158053791X">by A Copd. “A Practitioner's Guide to Software Test Design”</a> . </p><br><p>  Do not worry, we will give a project and an example to follow.  During the break we will rest, play, eat pizza and talk. </p><br><p>  Participation, as always, is free, but you need to register. </p><br><p>  Choose your city: <br>  <a href="https://eventskbkontur.timepad.ru/event/893276/">Ekaterinburg</a> , <br>  <a href="https://eventskbkontur.timepad.ru/event/894049/">Peter</a> , <br>  <a href="https://eventskbkontur.timepad.ru/event/894054/">Novosibirsk</a> </p><br><p>  Good luck! </p></div>
