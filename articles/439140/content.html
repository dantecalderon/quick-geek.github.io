But some will find out about them only now, continuing to ask questions in the comments or to the support service.  So let's do it again: <br><br><ol><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/tm/blog/435766/">There was an English-language Habr</a> - now you can read / write publications / comments in English.  Publications in English in the tape - this is a new reality, and not something incomprehensible. </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/tm/blog/437072/">We have introduced loosening for users</a> - now you can cross-post your publications, write about your private projects and games, free software, post links to resumes, and more.  It is no longer a violation of the rules. </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/tm/blog/437354/">We have increased the voting period for publications up to 30 days</a> .  Because of this, <a href="https://habr.com/ru/info/help/posts/">PPA-</a> publications had a hitch with the accrual of bonuses and their payment, but everything has already been recounted and calculated. </li></ol></blockquote>  And most importantly - about invites. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  On the launch day of the English version, all users with positive karma received an invitation to Habr, which alerted some.  Do not worry, this is normal.  You can call a friend or invite a good person for <a href="https://habr.com/ru/sandbox/">publishing from the Sandbox</a> . <br><br>  <b>Huge request:</b> before issuing an invitation, check when the author was last on the site.  If more than a year ago, it probably makes sense to present an invitation to someone more “fresh” and active. <br><br>  Positive read and comment accounts also had positive karma.  The invoice he had accrued was immediately activated for pumping the account to a full one, as a result of which the user says in his profile that he invited himself.  This, again, is not a bug, but a feature. <br><br>  We also fixed the errors found after the updates.  If you find something else, <a href="https://habr.com/ru/feedback/">please let us know</a> . </div>
