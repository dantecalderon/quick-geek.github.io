To understand the viability of the HYIP technology, we firstly summarized the results of our research in this topic, and secondly, we invited Pavel Chertorogov, an open-source meyntteyner, who has been developing isomorphic applications since the end of 2015.  In the summer of 2016, Pavel began the development of graphql-compose in the open source. <br><br>  For those who could not come, we will publish video reports. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Dmitry Mamonov, Wrike - GraphQL and Web Application Architecture </h2><br>  What is common between GraphQL and SQL, how GraphQL changes the architecture of Web applications, what are the fundamental problems in current implementations of the GraphQL concept itself. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wvOUa8W3nM0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h2>  Pavel Chertorogov, Independent Developer - GraphQL Schemes Design and Design Patterns </h2><br>  What is the most convenient way to design GraphQL for front-end vendors?  GraphQL diagram can turn your head in pain and a bunch of additional code for developers.  Therefore, the more convenient the scheme, the faster, easier and with fewer errors will be developed. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nkv0eDE5FbA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h2>  Alexey Zolotykh, Wrike - GraphQL - New Redux </h2><br>  GraphQL is another standard for server requests.  So many people think.  In his report, Lesha will try to prove that GraphQL is also a qualitative leap in the development of the frontend as a whole.  And the world will never be the same. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gPb0y4ZND9c" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
