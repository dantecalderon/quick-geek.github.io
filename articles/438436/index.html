I watched this report, ‚ÄúHow we fired the admin‚Äù, in the recording.  The speaker said that all web companies are having problems with passwords, and I had an idea how to solve this.  Most likely, someone has already done it, but, honestly, I don‚Äôt know, I just want to describe it, then maybe someone will do it or I will do it myself somehow.  I hope if someone decides to do something like this it will be opensource. <br><br><h3>  Actually description of the problem and how to solve it. </h3><br>  What is the problem, if not strange in the passwords themselves, more precisely so that unscrupulous employees do not take them away from the company. <br><br>  There are two options for solving this problem. <br><br><ol><li>  Post all changes to the site personally to the head of the company. </li><li>  Something to think and do. </li></ol><br>  In general, we act according to the second option.  The first is difficult and expensive if the company consists of a small number of people. <br><br>  What you have decided to do, now you need to decide how to do it. <br><br>  Here's the simplest idea right away, why not make a proxy?  Well, most likely a super proxy.  The scheme of work in principle is simple and I drew it below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ii/fi/st/iifist7varisrnulf8vgpdzq-x8.png"><br>  <i>Figure 1 - the general scheme of the system</i> <br><br>  As can be seen from the diagram and the idea itself, the main element here will be a proxy server. <br><br>  His tasks are as follows: <br><br><ul><li>  Accordingly, to receive traffic, or even work at the level of SSH and SFTP commands, to begin with, and send a response from the client‚Äôs server to a specialist. </li><li>  Authentication and authorization specialist </li><li>  Check the legitimacy of the teams, this can be done later. </li></ul><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The structure of the proxy server itself will be as follows: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k9/k4/s0/k9k4s0plfu228o5llqwxajzcehq.png"><br>  <i>Figure 2 - Block diagram of the super-proxy component</i> <br><br>  <i>Proxy - directly proxies traffic via SSH, (S) FTP, HTTP, HTTPS</i> <i><br></i>  <i>CA (Control Access) - Controls the access of specialists to client resources.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>SAP (Sever Admin Panel) - Directly the server with which the administrator is associated, through the control panel.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Core - Directly the core of the system deals with the management of requests between modules and model management.</i> <br><br>  I think that it is worthwhile to dwell on the access separately, since this was the reason for this. <br><br>  All users are included in group policies, group policies define the rules for access to client servers, as well as rules that system administrators are subject to.  Group policies have a hierarchical structure, each top level has its own same powers as the bottom level.  From the beginning there is a policy '.', It includes all permissions for everything, and it can include one user the main administrator.  Then there are two groups for policies, system administrators and projects. <br><br>  <i>Summary table - administrators and their rights</i> <br><table><tbody><tr><th>  Role name </th><th>  Access rights </th><th></th></tr><tr><td>  Group Policy Administrator </td><td>  Editing users in group policy </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  Group Policy Administrator </td><td>  Create Group Policy </td><td>  Create delete and edit users in Group Policy </td></tr><tr><td>  User Management Administrator </td><td>  Remove user from group policy </td><td>  Create delete and edit users </td></tr><tr><td>  Backup manager </td><td>  Reading information about users and administrators </td><td>  Reading Group Policy Records </td></tr><tr><td>  Chief Administrator </td><td>  Everything and everyone else, as well as editing and deleting group policies </td><td>  Forced change of passwords on client servers </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  Group policies themselves contain an entry about the server to which this policy applies. <br>  And users have the following rules, which are prescribed for each user or group separately, in fact, these are Boolean values, which determines whether the object has HTTP / HTTPS access to the resource control panel (admin panel), SFTP / FTP, SSH access. <br><br>  Now there are a couple of words about the control panel and the client. <br><br>  The control panel, or everything is clear, but you need to write again, that would be exactly clear. <br>  Control Panel.  It is directly needed to manage group policies and the server as a whole, a super proxy.  Distributed as a separate application or web service. <br><br>  Accordingly, administrators have access to the control panel. <br><br>  The client is simple in appearance, complex inside. <br><br>  The client needs an application, in the case of HTTP (S), purely theoretically, this application can be a browser directly configured to work through a proxy server, and our proxy server will have to wedge traffic.  In general, rather, everything, you will need to develop a separate application that will work over SSH, (S) FTP, HTTP (S), with client servers, through our super-proxy server, or even it will be easier, it will actually install and communicate with the client servers are themselves a super-proxy server, and in the client itself, installed on a computer by specialists, the whole process will simply be emulated. <br><br>  Consider the example of HTTP (S). <br><br><ol><li>  The client sends a request to the proxy server to contact the client. </li><li>  The super proxy server allows it or not, if it does, the super proxy server itself raises the connection and is authorized in the control panel. </li><li>  Super-proxy server receives directly the main page of the admin panel. </li><li>  The super-proxy server sends this page to the client, replacing the address of the client resource with a special marker. </li><li>  The specialist follows the links or fills in the fields in the browser and submits the form.  The data goes to the super proxy server. </li><li>  The super-proxy server replaces the tokens back to the address of the client resource and accordingly sends it directly to the client resource itself. </li></ol><br>  With SSH, you can transfer pure text.  And directly from the super-proxy server to the client's resource, a normal SSH connection rises. <br><br>  That's about something like that.  Waiting for your feedback in the comments, and links to repositories, if someone decides to make such a system. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/438436/">https://habr.com/ru/post/438436/</a></p>
