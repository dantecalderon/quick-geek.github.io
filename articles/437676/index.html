  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Universities and Corporate Accelerators as a lever for launching a B2B startup in the USA</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Having tried myself as an entrepreneur in various industries - from logistics to the production of drinking water, I found my true vocation in engineering, having undertaken to help my friend, a mega-engineer, to turn his workshop into an engineering company.  Everything was cool until the end of 2013, when sad times appeared on the horizon and I had already fallen into depression - until March 2014, when I read about emigration through Habr√© to receive the American IBA. <br><br>  The United States became my first foreign country in 2000 after participating in the Work &amp; Travel program and we arranged a wedding with my future wife for two in Las Vegas in 2008, so the choice of the country was not. <br><br>  After a year and a half, in August 2015, I began my studies at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ef/yv/mz/efyvmznvm9vhu775tbv5zsa0bym.jpeg"></div><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>The layout of the article is as follows:</b> <br><br>  1. Opportunities for startups in American universities <br><br>  a.  Business plan contests <br>  b.  Investments from public funds <br><br>  2. Corporate project and technology competitions <br><br>  3. Global industrial accelerators <br><br><h2>  1. Opportunities for startups in American universities </h2><br>  At familiarization meetings, we were told a lot about the deep integration of the university with global technology corporations, but it was all in the context of job search.  And when, at the business session, they told us what technologies came out of the university, and what technologies were coming up, then it became really interesting.  The most breakthrough technology was invented at the university UHF diodes capable of operating at frequencies up to hundreds of THz and up to 30 GHz in zero-bias mode, promising revolutionary perspectives in electronics. <br><br>  I tried unsuccessfully to establish contact with the professor-inventor for 7 months, but it turned out only in the summer of 2016, when instead of a generously paid summer internship in Google, I signed up for almost free volunteering at the University Office of Technology Transfer - with the condition that they put me on this project. <br><br>  Summer has flown by examining potential applications of technology, the size of markets and the way they emerge: from radio signal detectors and radio telescopes to the conversion of radio waves into electricity.  By the fall, it became clear that our main goal was to offer the market eternal batteries, drawing energy from the background radio. <br><br>  Active and even in certain areas - the leading role of universities in shaping the strategic agenda in business and public administration is one of the main distinguishing features of American education.  In addition to the fact that educational institutions are aimed at issuing ready-made specialists for work in the core industries, there are close feedback from companies that order and sponsor research and then implement them in production and business.  So, one of my tasks, as an intern at the Technology Transfer Office, was to create a database of all past, current and future research works for operational interaction with potential customers and investors from the business. <br><br>  There are also practical courses when a company orders a market research or a very specific development, and a whole course of students, divided into groups, works for a whole semester on a solution with a final presentation at the end.  It is not always possible to expect breakthrough solutions from students, but from the entire stream there will usually be one or two teams that will give something interesting. <br><br>  Startups in universities are usually born out of course projects. <br><br><h3>  1.a.  Business plan contests </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/v9/l4/tz/v9l4tzbr_cc6o4wyhi8wfelnkos.jpeg"></div><br>  So, a cool idea, perhaps powered by university technology, vigorous guys with burning eyes - the University Center for Entrepreneurship comes next (I think they are now at every university, because one of the criteria in university rankings (a very important thing in the states) is the number of companies created by graduates). <br><br>  You can continue to work on a startup as part of a course on entrepreneurship or with the support of a business department to prepare for local / regional / national business plan competitions (Pitch Competitions) - there would be a desire.  Again, the involvement of business in university life leads to the fact that they are interested in these competitions ‚Äî they sponsor and carefully study investors and industry representatives, so participation can provide an opportunity not only to raise money, but also to get access to important partnerships. <br><br>  My experience was marked by two second places in the <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/swartz-center-for-entrepreneurship/events/mcginnis-venture-competition/past-winners.html">university</a> and <a href="https://cleantechprize.org/2017-final-pitches/">regional</a> competitions, which allowed to establish personal contact with the vice president of Walmart for technology and energy, director of innovation from Phillips a dozen other reputable and useful for business development people, well, and $ 50,000 prize money.  Taking the top prize in my category at the <a href="http://www.flow.caltech.edu/2017-winners">California Institute of Technology</a> , I established contact with the Director of Innovation at EPRI (Research Institute for Electrical Energy), the most authoritative organization that determines the development of the entire electric power industry.  In general, university competitions in the USA are a real springboard for big business. <br><br>  It is important to note that startups born from the technology developed at the university and at the expense of the university usually give the university a share in the authorized capital and additionally pay royalties for using the technology.  Usually there is a certain standard practice, uniform for university.  In Carnegie Mellon, this is 7% of the share capital and 2-3% of income. <br><br>  Observance of intellectual rights is carefully monitored by the Technology Transfer Office and from time to time there are echoes of high-profile lawsuits to this effect ( <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/marvell-to-pay-750-million-in-settlement-with-carnegie-mellon-1455746246">global for $ 750 million c Marvell Technology</a> ). <br><br><h3>  1.b.  Investments from public funds </h3><br>  The California Institute of Technology contests and Allegheny Cleantech of Pennsylvania were regional selection rounds of the <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/technology-to-market/cleantech-university-prize-cleantech">national Department of Energy</a> (DOE) <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/technology-to-market/cleantech-university-prize-cleantech">national competition</a> , so I had the opportunity to perform in Washington. <br><br>  Research grants from relevant ministries are an important source of funding for university research.  The state body determines the strategically important topics that are published on the website of relevant ministries  Universities (and private companies) submit their applications, which are blindly selected by a panel of industry experts from the academy and industry.  Winners usually receive grants in 2-3 parts, as they reach the previously agreed goals: $ 150-250 thousand;  $ 1-2 million;  $ 3-5 million - depending on the nature of the project, but in sufficient volume to produce a demonstration sample and reduce risks for commercial investments. <br><br>  Having used the grant, the sponsored company usually reserves the right of ownership for the development, but transfers the non-exclusive license to use it to the Sponsor.  Further, managing the created intellectual property, the developer can either sell commercial licenses or sell his own product. <br><br>  Grants are one of the main tasks of university professors.  If your research meets the national interests of the United States (or can be submitted as such), there is an excellent chance to get a lot of free money for this business.  One problem is time.  From writing to receiving money, it can easily pass a year, so it‚Äôs good to have a fallback. <br><br>  <b>Where to go:</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ti/jf/6b/tijf6bnsxooraj0zpgcbk6nmiia.png"></a>  - A wide range of topics focusing on fundamental discoveries.  Program managers identified as responsible for conducting the selection usually perform administrative functions, the decision is made by a committee of experts who do not know each other and do not see the authors of the requests in order to ensure an objective assessment. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="https://science.energy.gov/grants/foas/open/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nj/rm/qo/njrmqop22hvbnm4vbdojzriwo2w.png"></a>  - obviously - everything related to energy.  At the same time, topics may be connected with energy quite indirectly - here the experience of attracting by the ears is useful - for example, to tie up the project of greenhouses on hydroponic technology, as a means of saving fresh water, which in turn saves energy.  Well, you understand ... <br><br>  o <a href="https://arpa-e-foa.energy.gov/">ARPA-E</a> <br>  o <a href="https://www.nrelforum.com/Attend/Attend-the-Forum%3Futm_source%3DJackie%26utm_medium%3Ddirect%26utm_campaign%3Digf_mktg">National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)</a> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="https://www.grants.gov/learn-grants/grant-making-agencies/department-of-defense.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/c9/-u/nq/c9-unqwkkd91ynhj1z0k1cyeukw.png"></a>  - defense Department.  Here, the final decision is made by the program manager, therefore the establishment and maintenance of fruitful cooperation is important at an early stage.  There is a nuance - the export of development of military or dual use (when they can theoretically be used for military purposes), developed under the grant, will either be completely closed or severely limited. <br><br>  o <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/opportunities">DARPA</a> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ There are other ministries, full access to grants here - <a href="https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/search-grants.html">Grants.gov</a> <br><br>  Our application to the NSF six months later was rejected because of the ‚Äúinsufficient ambition‚Äù of the stated goals.  It would be possible, of course, to fight next year, but for lack of time we went another way: <br><br><h2>  2. Corporate project and technology competitions </h2><br>  American companies take universities seriously as a source of inspiration and innovative thought.  In addition, after clicking on the nose of startups who turned over entire industries and having read Christensen's Innovator Dilemma, global corporations began to young and create corporate accelerators with the intention of "disrupt ourselves" (tearing themselves off?). <br><br>  Despite the obvious contradiction in the mission, such an outsourcing of innovation allows you to acquire rising stars in the form of successful products, technologies and teams.  And for start-up teams this can mean a lot of free (possibly) money, access to a ready-made big market or instant pumping up the reputation in the industry. <br><br>  The prerequisite for participation in many such contests is a link with an American university, so start-ups actively use their university roots to either draw the necessary link or take a graduate student who becomes a pass to the world of opportunities. <br><br>  If in the venture environment, professors among founders and advisors are viewed with some distrust (‚Äúteaching‚Äù and ‚Äúinventing‚Äù is rarely combined with ‚Äúcreating a product‚Äù and ‚Äúselling‚Äù), then in corporate accelerators, where PhD experts and scientific consultants (well, of course, the best forces rush to innovation) - the university aura adds points. <br><br>  I was fed into everything related to electrical engineering: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/m6/uy/_c/m6uy_cpaf9xysnc2fa4eon2i8kq.gif">  <a href="https://cisco.innovationchallenge.com/cisco-global-problem-solver-challenge-2019">Global Problem Solver Challenge</a> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lo/3z/2g/lo3z2gf6hhz7yal5dwko90qe1g4.jpeg">  <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/prize/">Bell labs prize</a> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_p/yo/by/_pyobymtpo0i2i5kqtdyamknaqg.png">  <a href="https://www.bosch.us/our-company/innovation/">Energy Research Network (BERN)</a> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jz/_q/nh/jz_qnhghz8z_fl_efzpj03hegjm.png">  <a href="https://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/innovating-together/shell-gamechanger.html">Shell game changer</a> <br><br>  Completing each application makes it necessary to look at the needs of the market from a new angle, to understand which product to develop, so that the consumer wants to pay for it even before it is born.  If at first I tried to sell Cisco technology that ‚Äúwill revolutionize electronics‚Äù, then I came to solving specific problems for Shell and calculating the savings on the maintenance of wireless corrosion sensors produced in partnership with the leading manufacturer of anti-corrosion equipment from the UK. <br>  The specifics and focus on today's partner problems worked better than castles in the air. <br><br><h2>  3. Global industrial accelerators </h2><br>  The possibilities don't end there.  Driven by good intentions and PR considerations, global corporations unite to solve strategic energy security problems on a planetary scale and create international funds and accelerators investing in ambitious projects that directly or indirectly solve energy and environmental problems. <br><br>  Many of these programs provide grants of $ 1 million to selected companies, access to the best experts, and business benefits up to the state level.  In general - solid pluses. <br><br>  Here are the ones I interacted with and I can recommend: <br><br> <a href="https://www.cyclotronroad.org/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l9/zv/mp/l9zvmpwoyk0inuejm33cfbnfpak.png"></a> <br><br> <a href="https://elementalexcelerator.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dl/ws/x1/dlwsx1ikd410cj18lwbuhef1fdw.png"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://www.freetheelectron.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/i6/qk/d1/i6qkd1hoiykxybrkadqvyuqqopu.png"></a> <br><br> <a href="https://energynexus.co/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0f/qb/jz/0fqbjz55kyful1j80u2hlduvdim.png"></a> <br><br> <a href="https://www.greenchallenge.info/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/20/la/td/20latd6_h0bcbjlttwnqasy6tua.jpeg"></a> <br><br> <a href="https://www.solutions2030.ca/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9x/mx/wf/9xmxwffxeyk78hflhb0o7obww-0.png"></a> <br><br>  By registering on the websites of these organizations, you will receive regular notifications about planned opportunities, selections, landmark events and investments.  If your project at least partially falls into the mainstream with its global nature and potential positive effect, something suitable will appear sooner or later. <br><br>  I hope someone my story will help you run your project or serve as an inspiration for creating technology that will save the world.  All the nuances in the article, of course, do not put - so write - I will advise what I can. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/437676/">https://habr.com/ru/post/437676/</a></p>
