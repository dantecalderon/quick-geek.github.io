<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There are several tens of millions of electronic components in the world.  To work effectively with so much information it is impossible to do without special search tools.  Therefore, in order to simplify the connection between the buyer, the seller and the manufacturer, there are so-called "Search engines for electronic components."  At the moment, you can count about twenty such platforms, both Russian and foreign. <br><br>  Due to the nature of my business, I often use these platforms for searching and ordering components.  First, through a parametric search on digikey, we are looking for the necessary component, then through a chipfind we find a Russian supplier.  Know yourself?  If yes, then this article is for you. <br>  Fans generally use platforms that are well advertised, simply without knowing the possibility of choice.  Experts use not one, but the whole set.  In this article I will try to answer the question: why is there no universal platform for searching electronic components? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  All electronic component platforms can be divided by origin into Russian and foreign.  To Russian, i.e.  focused only on users on the territory of the Russian Federation, include such platforms as efind, chipfind, optochip, etc.  Foreign: Digikey, mouser, etc. work around the world. <br><br><h3>  Technique </h3><br>  The analysis of electronic platforms was carried out according to 16 criteria that determine the functionality of the platform.  The presence of the implemented function brings the platform 1 point, and the absence of 0 points.  It's simple.  If the function is declared by the developers of the platform, but is under development, then the platform receives 0.5 points.  Subjective criteria are beyond the scope of this analysis: design, usability, access cost.  Based on the results of the analysis, a rating will be compiled. <br><br>  <b>List of participating platforms</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5h/ns/zh/5hnszh0blixvge_-zolxhtuo6tk.png"><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Hidden text</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The following platforms did not make the list above: icmania.ru, rel.ru, chipportal.ru, zFind.ru due to the inaccessibility of their site at the time of writing this article (January 2018) </div></div><br>  <b>The results of the analysis of the "Russian platforms"</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ao/im/d1/aoimd1_hdkpfp8llknnmrmy85o0.png"><br><br>  <b>The results of the analysis of "Foreign platforms"</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gx/ex/wq/gxexwq-tqdrwpztz8aujy9dt2dk.png"><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Summary table, analysis results</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/as/4f/nh/as4fnh9umjwdh1dgykznowe9vy4.png"><br>  <i>* Submitted information is current as of January 2018</i> <br><br>  1 - the presence of the Russian language on foreign platforms, the presence of English on Russian platforms; <br>  2 - partial translation; <br>  3 - excluding advertising services; <br>  4 - search is implemented for only several sections; <br>  5 - only the section of electronic components; <br>  $ - paid access </div></div><br><h3>  Final rating </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6t/-o/f9/6t-of9qx-azyd8u98ddth0jwchg.png"><br>  <i>Access to Brokerforum.com is paid, after 15 days of the trial period will be $ 400 for six months.</i>  <i>There is no information about access for individuals.</i> <br><br><h3>  findings </h3><br>  The considered platforms can be divided into aggregators and search engines according to their functional characteristics.  Aggregators receive information on the availability of electronic components from suppliers or by parsing information from other platforms, including digikey and mouser.  Search engines are much more complex aggregators, in addition to information about the balance in warehouses provide tools to search for electronic components on the technical characteristics (parametric search). <br><br>  Russian platforms have a common flaw - the lack of an English version of the site, additional thematic services, forums, directories, a mobile application.  On foreign platforms, we can say that they have only one drawback - the absolute absence of electronic components of domestic production. <br><br>  Of all the platforms considered, only one (Optochip.org) has the ability to parametrically search for domestic components.  On three platforms (eFind.ru, ChipFind.ru, Optochip.org) there is the possibility of selecting an analog import / domestic products, domestic products / imports.  Also, only three platforms have a group search for components (Optochip.org, FindChips.com, Farnell.com).  Thematic literature was posted on its website: Optochip.org, compel.ru, Digikey.com, Farnell.com.  The forum for users of the platform is present at eFind.ru, Digikey.com, Farnell.com.  The results of “Additional thematic services” turned out to be quite interesting - all foreign companies provide additional services (analytics, promotion, delivery, etc.) from Russian only one Optochip.org.  Also, most foreign platforms have a mobile app. <br><br>  At the moment there is not a single Russian electronic component platform focused on the international market.  And all existing foreign platforms are not focused on Russian.  That is why there is no universal platform for searching electronic components. <br><br>  Do not think for advertising, I personally use the following set: Digikey, Brokerforum $, Optochip.  For those who do not want to pay for access, I can recommend the following set: Digikey or Mouser, Alibaba, Optochip. </div>
