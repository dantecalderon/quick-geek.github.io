Thus, an observer, when accessing any news from the Top 5 service, in 100% of cases, will see on the page with the news itself links to four of the most “privileged” news agencies, and in 95% of cases - links to three slightly less “privileged »Agencies. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/90b/c2c/c47/90bc2cc4737044e54c2d4bd60597f161.png" alt="image"></div><br>  That is, in fact, 7 of 9 positions of the Yandex.News service, which are presented to the visitor as an objective means of selecting the most relevant news with the help of so-called robots, working according to specified algorithms, will be in advance occupied. <br><br>  Moreover, as a REGNUM editorial staff explains, the arguments of the developers of the Top 5 Yandex.News service about the existence of objective criteria for building a “top” are simply untenable, since it is statistically improbable that an empirically proven fact 100% fall into the “top” news of a specific information agency .  So, they make a conclusion in the REGNUM editorial office that the “top” of news is formed not so much by using objective criteria, which, by the way, have not been disclosed by “Yandex”, but by some “weight” of the media, which, apparently, by man. <br><br>  Thus, based on a detailed statistical study of the “Top 5 Yandex.News” service, the REGNUM editors request the FAS to recognize the actions of Yandex LLC in forming the “News Top” as violations of Part 1 of Art.  10 and art.  14.3 of the Federal Law of July 26, 2006 N 135-ФЗ “On Protection of Competition” and issue to Yandex LLC an order to stop the violation of antitrust laws and prohibit the transfer of the Top News to the main search page. </div>
