<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It would seem that the creators of the "apple" devices made sure that their gadgets were perfect.  Here are just the majority of owners of these devices still face a number of problems associated with the closeness of iOS.  Since the release of the first iPhone, users have continued to wonder how to expand the memory of their device.  And when you buy Apple equipment, you have to take into account that the capacity of the internal memory is constant.  Or not? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fec/dcc/50b/fecdcc50bc06bf3633b354d1256075c9.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  From the ninth version of iOS, it began to turn more and more to users, allowing it to connect all sorts of peripherals.  Already, then throw the pictures on the USB flash drive - a trifling matter.  Especially when you have a Kingston DataTraveler Bolt. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/136/942/b90/136942b90c7f5357acadd36b4ebfceb3.jpg"><br><br>  It is noteworthy that Apple itself released (and continues to release) special adapters for the same SD cards, only they work in a very peculiar way: instead of transferring from the device’s memory to an external drive, it’s suggested to upload the camera content to a mobile device.  Quite a dubious idea - except that there is no other device for displaying the image at hand, but you need to see the photos here and now.  What is even more interesting, adapters with inverse functionality in Cupertino continue to be ignored, but they successfully certify accessories from third-party manufacturers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e82/930/000/e82930000661161858f1115bce1234fc.jpg"><br><br><ul><li>  Form Factor: USB Flash <br></li><li>  Interface: USB 3.1 Gen 1 / Lightning <br></li><li>  Memory capacity: 32, 64 or 128 GB <br></li><li>  Dimensions: 40.7 × 12.2 × 7 mm, in a case - 65 × 20 × 11 mm <br></li><li>  Weight: 7.2 g, in the case - 14.4 g. <br></li></ul><br><h2>  Packaging </h2><br>  Modest cardboard packaging, plastic box - nothing more.  The flash drive itself is “wrapped” in a metal case: break or bend like this - you have to rub it, so there are no kilograms of foam or “pimples” inside.  The main thing that is printed on the front side of the case (except for indicating the drive capacity) is the MFI certification logo, which guarantees work with any current and future version of iOS.  Considering how they like to “fall off” after the next firmware update, various noname-accessories, this moment should not be ignored.  Inside the box, in addition to the flash drive itself, there is a rubber case with a ring that can be mounted on the keys.  The drive inside it is held qualitatively, no shaking is terrible: only the conscious desire of the user to get it and use the device.  Another plus of this method of storage is static protection.  In our world of victorious synthetics and surrogate tissue, the accumulation of things of decent potential is a common thing.  And with this thing you can insert a USB flash drive and remove it without fear that a spark will erupt between it and sensitive electronics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ae3/88d/8be/ae388d8bee9a2fed25d48fad30306549.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Appearance </h2><br>  The design and design of DataTraveler Bolt do not differ much from the set of modern flash drives - belonging to the “i-devices” gives only the Lightning plug, located opposite the classic USB Type A for connection to a computer.  The size of the gadget is 40.7 × 12.2 × 11 mm, when worn in a case it is 65 × 20 × 11 mm, the weight barely exceeds 7 grams. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/43c/d18/bd3/43cd18bd3cf50b98bc5e2e49b672392c.jpg"><br><br>  The case is completely aluminum, its production uses the same manufacturing process as Apple devices.  So the appearance of the accessory will be perfectly combined with your brand new “X” or classic 5S.  The only thing that distinguishes the USB flash drive from the original “apples” is the lack of a corporate imprint with a “stub” on aluminum, instead of it is the native logo.  The quality of workmanship is nowhere higher: the body is a monolith, the strength is almost endless.  As long as you do not use the Bolt as a hammer or opener, you will not have to worry about your safety in your daily work or on long trips.  Seriously, this is a molded piece of aluminum, what can become of it? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b5e/67b/ec7/b5e67bec7ba80d335a2ed03278105a4c.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Getting started </h2><br>  For the device to work correctly, you need to install the Kingston Bolt <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kingston-bolt/id1196880525%3Fmt%3D8">app</a> from the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kingston-bolt/id1196880525%3Fmt%3D8">App Store</a> on your smartphone or tablet.  It provides support for all functions of the gadget: backup photos from a smartphone to an external drive and photo-video with direct storage on a USB flash drive, and viewing media materials.  The application interface is simple and clear - even a baby will figure out the five buttons and classic galleries. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/an/h2/yn/anh2ynynrurud65j-voojfjshei.jpeg"><br><br>  When iOS is first launched, it will request access to the photos, after which the program will offer to make a full copy of all media files.  Subsequent backups will capture only new images and videos, which significantly reduces the time to create the next backup.  In addition, the application maintains separate indexes for each device used.  This means that you can back up multiple phones and use the drive to save other data from your computer.  Backups will be labeled according to the names of each gadget, and will not interfere with each other. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mx/-g/de/mx-gdeg-eov8uagfrbm-lo8sc9a.jpeg"></div><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ThXajoiNpGE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  In addition to the usual backup, the program provides several other useful options.  For example, you can create a backup on a flash drive by deleting the sources from the internal memory of the phone.  Transferring photos and videos from a flash drive to the phone, similar to the original accessories from Apple, is also available.  Also interesting is the mode of directly saving photos and videos to an external drive, bypassing the built-in memory.  This option will allow you to avoid unnecessary copying procedures with the subsequent removal, and simplifying viewing of the resulting media on external devices.  However, there is a much more interesting scenario.  Two seasons of the best series of the last year, full-length BD-rip in 720p on the road?  With a fill on the i-device, it will take a lot of time and almost all the space on your device, and even iTunes can show off.  With Bolt, it's about 30-40 minutes and zero problems. <br><br><h2>  Practical testing </h2><br>  Unfortunately, the certification process at Apple is quite strict and for the steps to the left or the right is not shooting, but close to that.  Therefore, at the moment DataTraveler Bolt is a pure photo accessories, the application does not yet provide any additional functionality.  You, of course, will be able to write anything on a USB flash drive - music or other documents, a cryptocurrency wallet or some other “secret” data.  That's just iOS itself with its insane DRM will not show anything.  However, in the future it is possible to update the application - here the only question is the goodwill of Apple.  Keyboards and browsers have already been allowed to change, perhaps, they will get to third-party drives? <br><br>  In terms of immediate functionality, everything is smooth.  Currently available as a full copy, and backup of only selected photos and videos, viewing them on the device and working with several iPhones in turn.  Backups are not mixed up, each gadget creates its own folder in which it stores all synchronized good.  To connect to a PC device uses the latest generation USB interface - 3.1 Gen 1. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9af/224/4ad/9af2244adce21438ef8b58c76a117790.jpg"><br><br>  Records in terms of copying speed should not be expected (however, the closeness of iOS also affects, not least the limiting performance when working with third-party devices), but for everyday use it will be quite enough.  In our test, transferring nearly 6 GB of data (500 photos and 20 good videos) from iPhone 8 to Bolt took about 12 minutes, and copying from the drive to the MacBook Pro - 42 seconds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/916/b60/2d0/916b602d0dad1a6b7176a57cb4111200.jpg"><br><br><h2>  findings </h2><br>  On the one hand, with the advent of Apple devices with a starting memory capacity of 64 GB, the relevance of external drives should have declined.  On the other - do not forget that not all users annually change their iPhone or iPad to a new model, and for a whole army of owners of smartphones with 16-32 GB, this flash drive will be an excellent acquisition.  Yes, and fans of mobile photos will appreciate the ability to save free space in the internal memory of a smartphone - because the smartphone is not eternal, but a flash drive?  What will she do?  Especially in such a reliable performance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/550/46c/90f/55046c90fa56b53504a0fd69bac07ee1.jpg"><br><br>  The application has room to grow: the “fruit company” will give up slackness - it will be possible to steer with other files, but for now you can make room for new impressions with one click or capture new ones on the go, even if your smartphone is packed to capacity.  In terms of the choice of storage tanks - there are all the most popular sizes.  32 GB for backups?  You are welcome.  Need more?  64 and 128 at your service. <br><br>  The Kingston DataTraveler Bolt USB-drive for <a href="http://kingston.gg/GeektimesBolt">32 GB</a> and <a href="http://kingston.gg/GeektimesBolt">64 GB</a> in Russia is sold exclusively in <a href="http://kingston.gg/GeektimesBolt">Citylink</a> stores. <br>  ___________________________________________________________________________ <br><br>  And we remind that for all fans of the products of Kingston and HyperX in our blog, <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/298637/">a competition is held</a> before March 28, in which there are: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://hyperx.gg/GeekFuryDDR4">HyperX Fury DDR4 Memory Kit</a> (HX426C16FWK2 / 32) </li><li>  <a href="http://hyperx.gg/GeekPulsefireCT">HyperX Pulsefire FPS Mouse</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://hyperx.gg/GeekFurySCT">Rug HyperX Fury S Pro XL</a> </li><li>  HyperX hoodies - 2 pieces. </li><li>  HyperX T-shirts - 5 pcs. </li></ul><br>  For more information about Kingston and HyperX products, visit <a href="https://goo.gl/RUKonh">the company's</a> official <a href="https://goo.gl/RUKonh">website</a> . </div>
