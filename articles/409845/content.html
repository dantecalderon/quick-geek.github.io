<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xr/v8/oo/xrv8oonld-hmjwvin2xoe2pcf9i.jpeg"><br><br>  Despite the global transition to digital technology and a focus on shooting, creativity and commercial projects, DJI suddenly decided to update its <a href="http://coptertime.ru/catalog/dji-goggles/">DJI Goggles glasses</a> and add some new features. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W0vsd3qcd9E" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The first thing that catches your eye is of course the color.  The body of glasses is made of black graphite plastic with red skin inserts.  Feelings from such a combination are very similar to the chair of a racing car. <a name="habracut"></a>  By the way, the perfect visual combination of this season will be <a href="http://coptertime.ru/catalog/dji-goggles/dji-goggles-racing-edition/">DJI Goggles RE</a> and the new <a href="http://coptertime.ru/catalog/dji-mavic-air/">Mavic Air in red</a> .  The difference between the white and red lining of the headband can be easily seen in the photos - simple rubber and leather. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/y-/ox/s8/y-oxs8y2m5m03twhzezilgggrtc.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/x7/ry/xp/x7ryxp7yo8m8gtksvkwca7cu5om.jpeg"><br><br>  Another change in the design was the slits for the glasses, they are thinner and better protect the glasses screens from glare.  To the delight of moviegoers, you can now watch any (MP4, MOV, MKV) videos recorded on flash cards. <br><br>  Dark finish resembles the <a href="http://coptertime.ru/catalog/dji-inspire-2-drones/">DJI Inspire 2</a> case and, of course, would be an excellent addition for professional operators, because they are able to provide excellent image and are fully protected from any glare and glare, allowing you to fully concentrate on shooting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vv/3o/df/vv3odfr0hy7z21fwvgk_g2clvs8.jpeg"><br><br>  An additional advantage is the presence of a head tracker in glasses, which means that it is possible to control the camera in flight by tilting the head.  But, the previous version of the glasses was also able.  Here the name itself speaks about the new feature - “Racing Edition” - informs us about the possibility of using it with racing copters.  The key point is the built-in 5.8GHz receiver capable of receiving an image from a racing driver, equipped with an analog 5.8GHz transmitter with close to zero delay. <br><br>  Thanks to Goggles RE's integrated headtracker, you can view spherical panoramas shot on the copter by simply turning your head.  In fact, you can pick up the places you like: launch a quadrocopter, activate the 360 ​​panorama shooting mode, and then at home with the help of DJI Goggles RE return to this place with the opportunity to examine everything in detail and once again enjoy the beauty. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bt/pm/q9/btpmq9sg3f-p0gdh7t34spayoa0.jpeg"><br><br>  In addition, if you lack the usual analog image, the quality of which always depends on the power and there is often “snow” and interference - DJI suggests using the OcuSync brand solution previously available only to owners of MavicPro. <br><br>  <a href="http://coptertime.ru/catalog/dji-goggles/dji-goggles-racing-combo/">The DJI Goggles Racing Combo Kit</a> consists of a transmitter, a receiver with glasses and a proprietary HD camera.  Such a system will allow you to receive a picture at a distance of up to 7km (FCC) with a resolution of up to 1280 * 960pix.  The camera has a central shutter (full-frame reading) and is free from “rolling shutter”, as well as from the appearance of the “jelly” effect, which often occurs on CMOS matrices with line-by-line reading.  All that "sees" the camera can be recorded immediately on the microSD card with glasses.  Unfortunately, the system does not know how to take a photo, although you can take a screenshot during the shooting process.  In addition, one more function was added - the system can receive telemetry from flight controllers of racing copters.  Currently F3, F4, KISS, Naze are supported, support of other controllers is also planned. <br><br>  In addition to the copters, DJI Goggles RE can be used with airplanes, robots, industrial drones, in search and rescue operations. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h0szNGVqc14" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Price points DJI Goggles Racing Edition 44290 rubles.
