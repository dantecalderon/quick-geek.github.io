<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the selection we will discuss the permitted wearable (low-power) radio stations of the permitted range (LPD433 / PMR446). <br><br>  These are inexpensive Chinese walkie-talkies such as Baofeng and Xiaomi, as well as accessories. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cy/ps/yn/cypsynr2y8m-kedsqdzpnfyjdbg.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Greetings to all! <br><br>  I would like to talk about the most popular wearable radio stations from China, which are suitable both for attacks on nature, and for team games, pokatushek, construction, simple daily tasks, successfully replacing a cell phone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ji/re/-a/jire-a0c047grect_qbhrngxyqu.jpeg"><br><br>  A few words about the nuances of choice. <br><br>  This is the cheapest radio station from China.  Of course there are more expensive, branded, powerful, for other uses, for example in the car. <br><br>  But simple radios, for example, for $ 12 per pair, can always come in handy to establish communications during loading operations, during high-altitude operations, or when installing SCS. <br><br>  When choosing, pay attention to the range and range of the radio.  It makes sense to take two, three, four radios per team, that is, a kit.  If you already purchase an existing kit, then pay attention to the range of work (LPD433 / PMR446).  It also makes sense to immediately purchase a cable for setting and flashing radios, as well as accessories.  For example, for Baofeng, “reinforced” antennas of the type NA-771 come in very handy. <br><br>  Now in order of popular lots. <br><br>  1. Not the newest, but the most popular <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/walkie-talkies/pp_262064.html%3Flkid%3D19090481">portable</a> radio <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/walkie-talkies/pp_262064.html%3Flkid%3D19090481">BAOFENG UV-5R UHF / VHF Walkie Talkie</a> .  Inexpensive, dual-band, with a removable antenna and a decent range (3-5 km).  There is a display, channel search and so on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/x0/nd/u8/x0ndu8tonu9et7wrr__eo2xr-mq.jpeg"><br><br>  <i>Specifications:</i> <br><br>  Brand: Baofeng <br>  Frequency range: 136 - 174 MHz (VHF) and 400 - 520 MHz (UHF), 65 - 108 MHz (FM reception only) <br>  Power: 5W <br>  Number of channels: 128 <br>  Functions: FM radio, Scan (Search) <br>  Work time: up to 12 hours <br>  Distance: up to 5 km. <br>  Battery: 1800mAh Li-ion <br>  Antenna: 50 ohms. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gn/xm/ja/gnxmjaaiylznrpki5hyvlgcjjmi.jpeg"><br><br>  Usually, a team of several similar radios, reinforced antennas or batteries, if necessary, but the firmware cable should be bought immediately.  Included is a wired headset, if desired, you can take the PTT, which is especially convenient in the car. <br><br>  2. The wearable walkie-talkie from Xiaomi is gaining popularity. <br><br>  This is <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/walkie-talkies/pp_009499633022.html%3Flkid%3D19090481">Xiaomi Mijia 1S Thin Body Outdoor Walkie Talkie</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vu/l0/hg/vul0hgfukrmfeolnz4b4fah4zby.jpeg"><br><br>  <i>Specifications:</i> <br>  Brand: Xiaomi <br>  Model: 1S <br>  Color Blue / White <br>  Transmitter power: 0.5W / 3W <br>  Battery: 2190mAh Li-Po <br>  Charging time: 3 hours <br>  Duration of work: talk time 16 hours / standby 5 days <br>  Wireless connection: <i>Bluetooth 4.2</i> <br>  Receive sensitivity: -122dBm (12dB SINAD) <br>  Rated power: 500mW <br>  Display: LED <br>  Public channels (L01-L20): 409MHZ-410MHZ (20 channels) <br>  Remote Channels (H01-H20): 430MHZ-440MHZ (20 channels) <br>  Custom channels (C01-C20): 430MHZ-440MHZ (20 channels) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gc/ej/5u/gcej5u2hodm2ej7cnvq3aiz7m5q.jpeg"><br><br>  The radio Xiaomi integrates into the MiHome “smart home” environment, there is a separate application for setting up the radio. <br><br>  I note the possibility of working with Bluetooth headphones and headsets.  The range of work depends on the terrain, 1-2 km. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/me/ej/s0/meejs0no4o-uir8ctarqwm2p7zm.jpeg"><br><br>  3.

At the beginning of the article I talked about accessories. <br><br>  It makes sense to buy a replacement antenna - long and flexible.
