Meet: Epson Moverio BT-35E</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  When we told the blog about our <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/epson/blog/217939/">Moverio BT-200</a> and <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/epson/blog/373781/">BT-300</a> binocular video <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/epson/blog/217939/">glasses</a> , one of the key features of the glasses was always called <i>low weight</i> (88 and 69 grams, respectively), which we managed to ensure by carrying the device‚Äôs brains into a separate control unit on Android base: </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6q/yj/ay/6qyjayvgejb1zgcz_lf92vjwgym.jpeg"><br><br><p>  The Android OS, of course, is a ‚Äúcapable‚Äù operating system, but some users are eager to go even further by <i>connecting glasses to a desktop computer or a compact solution based on Raspberry Pi</i> , thus developing their <b>own ‚Äúsoftware and hardware‚Äù solution</b> with Epson Moverio as an output device (in other words, "monitor"). </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/20/ep/-p/20ep-p-jrxdchixxbhfii9ftwfe.png"><br><p>  If you are one of those users, we have great news: <b>now it is possible</b> . </p><br><p>  Meet - <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/moverio/epson-moverio-bt-35e/">Epson Moverio BT-35E</a> . </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qb/fh/bc/qbfhbczokvynkpu92on_wikuylu.jpeg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Have waited </h2><br><p>  The Epson Moverio BT-35E eyewear model is designed to be used as a ‚Äúmonitor‚Äù or backup display and is connected directly to a signal source via HDMI and USB-C.  It is important to understand that this is <i>not an</i> update version of the Moverio BT-300, but a completely different model of glasses.  Those.  The Moverio BT-300 is still commercially available. </p><br><h2>  What is different from the Moverio BT-300 </h2><br><p>  In order to explain how the new version differs from the Moverio BT-300 version, let's recall what the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/epson/blog/402901/">Moverio BT-300 is</a> . </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qo/kk/s8/qokks8k4w8mlypg_15g_dugenwy.jpeg"><br><p>  <i>In short:</i> </p><br><p>  <b>Moverio BT-300 is the lightest augmented reality binocular video glasses.</b> </p><br><p>  The idea is this: transparent displays are embedded in the lenses of the glasses.  Those.  through the glasses you can see the "world around."  You can display any information on the display, it will be superimposed "on top of the surrounding space."  Points are connected to the control unit based on the Android OS.  You can download any application in this console and watch the relevant content.  In addition to the displays, glasses are equipped with a set of sensors and sensors, as well as a built-in camera for working with augmented reality applications. </p><br><p>  Anyone who is interested to learn more about them, please visit the <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/moverio/">page on our site</a> . </p><br><p>  Now I will tell you what is special about the <i>new version</i> . <br>  For clarity, put the data in a table: </p><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>&nbsp;</strong></td><td>  <strong>Moverio BT-300</strong> </td><td>  <strong>Moverio BT-35E</strong> </td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>Display</strong> </td><td>  Si-OLED </td><td>  Si-OLED </td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>Resolution</strong> </td><td>  1280 √ó 720 </td><td>  1280 √ó 720 </td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>operating system</strong> </td><td>  Android </td><td>  Not </td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>Dimensions points</strong> </td><td>  191 √ó 178 √ó 25 </td><td>  193 √ó 181 √ó 25 </td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>Interfaces</strong> </td><td>  Micro usb </td><td>  USB-C, HDMI </td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>Controller Dimensions</strong> </td><td>  116 √ó 56 √ó 23 </td><td>  85 √ó 50 √ó 15 </td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>Weight points, g</strong> </td><td>  69 </td><td>  119 </td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>Controller weight, g</strong> </td><td>  129 </td><td>  45 </td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>Warranty</strong> </td><td>  12 months </td><td>  24 months </td></tr></tbody></table><p>  The first and main difference: <b>they do not have their own "brains"</b> .  Points are connected only to the interface unit.  Without connecting to a signal source, they are as useful as a monitor without a computer. </p><br><p>  But unlike the three-hundredth version, they can be connected via HDMI or USB-C to any device.  Interface unit in all its glory: </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rd/a5/lx/rda5lxzln-hpcosebfzhohi6szk.jpeg"><br><br><p>  Since the Moverio BT-35E was created for commercial use, their body is made of more durable and wear-resistant materials (double magnesium layer).  And the arms are adjustable!  This feature was also added on the basis of feedback from real users of two-hundred and three-hundredth models. </p><br><p>  Those who wear ordinary diopter glasses will also be able to use the BT-35E, provided that the frame of the glasses is no longer than 147 mm. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ey/iz/fi/eyizfiil3s0dgp7ejvfwgq-m0ym.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  For whom and for what </h2><br><ul><li>  <b>Technical support.</b>  You can display information (instructions and manuals) in the form of three-dimensional animation, video, audio, photos, pictures or graphics.  A camera embedded in glasses can be used to recognize patterns, read bar codes or numbers, in order to carry out a convenient inventory or visually demonstrate, for example, editing steps. </li><li>  <b>Health care.</b>  Epson Moverio BT-35E can be used to duplicate readings from a patient monitor.  Without taking your eyes off the patient, the doctor will be able to see the status data on the video glasses displays.  And maybe the opposite.  For example, to give glasses to a patient in a dentistry - they will watch a movie while the doctor is busy. </li><li>  <b>Commercial drones.</b>  Still, Epson Moverio BT-35E video glasses can act as an FPV (First person view) 4 Pro device, as well as a role in a first-person display.  Those.  as a second FPV-display for controllers with the main screen and HDMI output on the auxiliary.  And it happens, yes. </li><li>  <b>Geeky</b>  Where do without them!  If you desperately need wearable transparent displays, then you can finally get them. </li></ul><br><h2>  How to buy </h2><br><p>  And here ... Mmm, how can I explain it ... </p><br><p>  In general, the situation is as follows: <i>openly</i> (i.e., in retail and online stores) there are no plans to sell glasses. </p><br><p>  This means that you can order them only by <a href="http://epson.ru/specials/moverio-customers/">leaving a request on the Epson website</a> . </p><br><p>  Why?  - The company decided that this product will most likely (given the price and form factor of the device) be used <i>in large or specialized projects</i> .  And due to the fact that the product, as you understand, is very ‚Äúniche‚Äù, you need to figure out what type of users and for which projects the Moverio BT-35E may, in principle, be needed.  To do this, each delivery must be registered in Epson. </p><br><p>  However, this does not mean that there are not enough points for everyone, or they are sold exclusively for the ‚ÄúKrupnyak.‚Äù  Just keep this in mind when you cannot find them in any of the retail stores. </p><br><p>  At cost, it turns out something average between BT-300 and BT-350 - around $ 1200. </p><br><h2>  Instead of output </h2><br><p>  <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/moverio/epson-moverio-bt-35e/">Epson Moverio BT-35E</a> is the first ‚Äúswallow‚Äù in the Epson binocular video <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/moverio/epson-moverio-bt-35e/">glasses</a> line, designed for use as a video output device.  If the market expresses interest in this model, it is possible that it will either go on sale in its current form or will receive ‚Äúheirs‚Äù who can finally get to open retail. </p><br><p>  In the meantime, if you are interested in this product and have ideas on the implementation of projects, please visit the form and <a href="http://epson.ru/specials/moverio-customers/">leave a request</a> for this new model. </p><br><hr><br><h3>  Notes in the discussion in the comments </h3><br><ul><li>  Points SDK will be available from March </li><li>  There are questions about lag.  Moverio BT-35E work simply "as a monitor."  We tested the specimen and did not find even minimally noticeable lag.  Official technical information about the lag in the specifications that we have on hand, no.  But compared to a conventional monitor, they did not see the difference when displaying a picture in the ‚Äúclone‚Äù mode.  If there is a delay, it can be because of the fault of the smartphone / tablet and any other device to which the glasses are connected, but not because of the glasses themselves, because they do not process the signal and only output before the eyes.  But of course you need to take into account the quality and length of the cable through which we connect, the longer the cable (especially if it is longer than 5 meters), the higher the likelihood of various ‚Äúsurprises‚Äù, especially when transmitting a signal of 60 Hz. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/438228/">https://habr.com/ru/post/438228/</a></p>
