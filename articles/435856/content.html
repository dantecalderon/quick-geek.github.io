<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It is interesting to look at the firewall market in one of the planes: what does antivirus engines look like? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/08b/1e7/c61/08b1e7c61297a34dd8c779e60d3cf939.png" alt="image"></div><br>  Antivirus is not just a certain set of signatures, but also an attached laboratory - after all, you need to find a new malicious code, create signatures and distribute them to your customers.  The situation is interesting: Check Point does not have its own antivirus, it includes the Kaspersky Lab engine (Kaspersky Lab) engine in the OEM, with which they have <a href="https://www.checkpoint.com/kaspersky/">difficulties due to the sanctions</a> and they built in some other engine, but this is not documented.  In the Russian office, they say that this is BitDefender.  In Cisco (FTD) included in the delivery ClamAV - free antivirus.  Fortinet (FortiGate) and Palo Alto Networks (NGFW) have their own antivirus engine and their own anti-virus labs that supply signatures.  The Russian vendor Entensys (UserGate) is the engines from LC, Panda, Avira.  The company Ideco (UTM) and Altell (NEO) is Kaspersky and ClamAV.  Other Russian firewalls of companies Security Code (Continent), Amykon (FPSU-IP), Infotex (ViPNet), Factor-TS (Dionis) do not have antivirus software at all. <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td width="164">  <b>Manufacturer Firewall</b> </td><td width="272">  <b>Who makes them antivirus</b> </td></tr><tr><td>  Altell (NEO) </td><td>  ClamAV, LC </td></tr><tr><td>  Amicon (FPSU-IP) </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  Check point </td><td>  LC, BitDefender </td></tr><tr><td>  Cisco (FTD) </td><td>  Clamav </td></tr><tr><td>  Entensys (UserGate) </td><td>  LC, Panda, Avira </td></tr><tr><td>  Factor-TS (Dionysus) </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  Fortinet (FortiGate) </td><td>  own </td></tr><tr><td>  Ideco (UTM) </td><td>  ClamAV, LC </td></tr><tr><td>  Infotecs (ViPNet) </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  Palo alto <br>  Networks (NGFW) </td><td>  own </td></tr><tr><td>  Security Code (Continent) </td><td>  - </td></tr></tbody></table></div>
