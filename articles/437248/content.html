Therefore, we decided that we should develop the direction on our own: for the beginning, we will organize a meeting in St. Petersburg in a “metap” format for FPGA developers and those interested in this topic. <br><br>  We are going for informal communication on January 29 at 19:00.  The event is called “FPGA Tales”.  There will be a couple of reports about what was encountered in 2018 in the development process, talk on near-FPGA's topics and coffee-buns-pizza. <br><br>  <b>Details <a href="https://general-rnd.timepad.ru/event/872606/">on the link</a> (ibid address and registration).</b> </div>
