<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Translation of the article <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2019/01/get-your-apps-ready-for-64-bit.html">Get your apps ready for the 64-bit requirement</a> (dated 1/15/2019) of the “Android Developers Blog” blog. <br><br>  Modern 64-bit processors increase the speed and enrich the experience of your users.  Adding a 64-bit version of the application gives an improvement in performance, opens ways for future innovations and adjusts to devices with only 64-bit hardware. <br><br>  We want to help you be ready, and we know that you need to plan time.  We support 64-bit CPUs starting with Android 5.0 Lolipop, and in 2017 we <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/12/improving-app-security-and-performance.html">announced</a> for the first time that applications using native code should have a 64-bit version (in addition to a 32-bit version).  Today we present more detailed information and a timeline to make this transition as easy as possible in 2019. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7fe/69f/6a9/7fe69f6a9d92791f0766696336a24acc.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  64-bit requirements: what does this mean for developers </h2><br>  Starting from August 1, 2019 <br><br><ul><li>  all new applications and updates to applications that contain native code must have a 64-bit version in addition to a 32-bit version when published to Google Play </li><li>  Update: Google Play will continue to accept 32-bit versions until August 20, only in terms of updating existing games using Unity version 5.6 or younger. </li></ul><br>  Starting from August 2021 <br><br><ul><li>  Google Play will stop servicing applications without 64-bit versions on 64-bit compatible devices, i.e.  they will no longer appear in the Play Store on these devices </li><li>  This will include games using Unity version 5.6 or less. </li></ul><br>  These requirements do not apply to: <br><br><ul><li>  applications designed exclusively for Wear OS or Android TV, because  they have a form factor that does not currently support 64-bit code </li><li>  apps not intended to be distributed on devices running Android 9 Pie or higher </li></ul><br>  We do not change our 32-bit support terms.  Play will continue to deliver applications to 32-bit devices.  This requirement only means that applications with 32-bit native code must additionally have a 64-bit version. <br><br><h2>  Preparing for 64-bit requirements </h2><br>  We expect that for most developers, the transition to 64-bit will be easy.  Many applications are written entirely in non-native code (for example, Java or Kotlin) and will not require changes to the code. <br><br>  TO ALL DEVELOPERS: here is an overview of the steps you need to do for 64-bit compatibility.  For more information, refer to our detailed <a href="https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/develop/64-bit">documentation.</a> <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Check your application</b> for native code.  You can check for .so files using <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/build/apk-analyzer">APK Analyzer</a> .  Determine whether they consist of your own code or imported from the SDK or the library you use.  If you do not have any .so files in your APK, then you are 64-bit compatible </li><li>  <b>enable 64-bit architecture</b> and rebuild native code (.so files) imported from your own code.  For more information, see the <a href="https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/develop/64-bit">documentation</a> . </li><li>  <b>Update all SDK and libraries</b> to 64-bit compatible versions, if necessary.  Contact the owner of the SDK or library if such versions are not available.  We are working with owners of leading libraries on their 64-bit compatibility. </li><li>  <b>check for local problems</b> after rebuilding your application </li><li>  <b>deploy your tests</b> using the <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/3131213%3Fhl%3Den">tasting track</a> for thorough testing </li></ul><br>  DEVELOPERS OF GAMES: all three most used engines currently support 64-bit (Unreal and Cocos2d since 2015, Unity since 2018).  We understand that the migration of a third-party game engine is a time consuming process. <br><br><ul><li>  because  Unity has only recently started providing 64-bit support in versions 2017.4 and 2018.2, we make an exception to existing games using version 5.6 or earlier before August 2021.  Unity has prepared a <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UpgradeGuides.html">guide</a> to help you upgrade for 64-bit compatibility. </li></ul><br>  OWNERS SDK AND LIBRARY: Upgrade to 64-bit compatibility as soon as possible to give application developers time to adapt, and let developers know about it.  <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfpLu80YoKRpkb17s_Jxq3bQMmAvMBHjt3cnlECV-fasE3Tvg/viewform">Register your SDK</a> for updates of the latest tools and information that can help service your users. <br><br><h2>  Farther </h2><br>  For those who already support 64 bits - thanks and good work!  For the rest, we recommend to start this work as soon as possible.  As we approach deadline, we will update our developer documentation in terms of how to check if your application matches.  We look forward to 64-bit processors entering such areas as artificial intelligence, machine learning, advanced mobile communications.  64-bit support prepares the ecosystem for innovations that expand the capabilities of 64-bit devices, and for Android devices that only support 64-bit code in the future </div>
