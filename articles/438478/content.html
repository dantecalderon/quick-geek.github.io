Thus, you will be able to build even more long-term strategic plans or organization goals - to create high-level epics with several levels of epic inside, breaking up the work into parts that are measurable from the point of view of delivery, up to tasks. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7e0/d19/939/7e0d199396ce3a98d12191217945fbdf.png" alt="Multi-level Child Epics"></p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/epics/">Documentation on the epic</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/8333">original ticket</a> . </p><br><h2 id="prosmotr-svyazey-mezhproektnyh-konveyerov">  View interproject pipeline links </h2><br><p>  (PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, SILVER, GOLD) </p><br><p>  Now, in the graph, on the pipeline view page, you can expand incoming and outgoing dependencies in the inter-project pipelines and get an idea of ​​all the pipelines involved - no matter what project they are running or ending. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aa1/896/812/aa18968123270c5820758ddd4a4ec1a1.png" alt="Cross-project pipeline browsing"></p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines.html">Documentation of conveyor schedules</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/2122">original ticket</a> . </p><br><h2 id="zakrytie-uyazvimosti-s-pomoschyu-patch-fayla">  Closing a vulnerability using a patch file </h2><br><p>  (ULTIMATE, GOLD) </p><br><p>  GitLab can detect various types of vulnerabilities in your applications and suggest possible ways to fix them. </p><br><p> Starting with the release of GitLab 11.7, you can download the patch file and apply it to your repository with the <code>git apply</code> .  Then send the changes to the repository, and <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/security_dashboard.html">the security panel will</a> confirm that the vulnerability is closed.  This simplifies the process of solving such problems and reduces the time needed to apply the solution.  Currently, dependency scanning reports known vulnerabilities in NodeJS projects running under the <code>yarn</code> package manager, and no additional effort is required.  The patch will be displayed in the vulnerability details window when it is available. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bcf/92b/496/bcf92b496303a16400013d87012d48ad.png" alt="Remediate vulnerability with patch file"></p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/">Documentation on the proposed solutions</a> and the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/5656">original ticket</a> . </p><br><h2 id="vozmozhnost-zadat-klyuchi-sekrety-prilozheniya-peremennymi-v-kubernetes">  Ability to set application secret keys to variables in Kubernetes </h2><br><p>  (CORE, STARTER, PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, FREE, BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD) </p><br><p>  Operators and administrators need to configure key-secrets outside the application repository in order to reduce the risk of disclosing sensitive data.  GitLab now offers the ability to configure key-secrets as environment variables that are available to the application in your Kubernetes cluster. </p><br><p>  Simply start the variable name with <code>K8S_SECRET_</code> , and the corresponding CI pipeline will accept it as the key secret of your Kubernetes application. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/83c/657/64a/83c65764a22db0ae6ab85f178d033688.png" alt="Configure Kubernetes app secrets as variables"></p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/autodevops/">Documentation on setting up keys-secrets</a> and the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/49056">original ticket</a> . </p><br><h2 id="reestr-npm-paketov">  Registry NPM-packages </h2><br><p>  (PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, SILVER, GOLD) </p><br><p>  JavaScript developers need a reliable, standardized way to share NPM packages and manage their versions among projects.  The package registry for NPM gives this opportunity to the developers of low-level services when publishing their code. </p><br><p>  In GitLab 11.7, we added the NPM package registry built into GitLab.  This means that developers can now use a simple agreement on the name of the packages to use the library in any Node.js project, while NPM and GitLab will do the rest.  All this is available through the same interface.  This feature will be available in GitLab Premium. </p><br><p>  Look at the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/examples/npm-publish">sample project</a> in which the build and paste into the registry. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/225/634/da0/225634da06946501b04e7aeee6790c27.png" alt="NPM registry"></p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/packages/npm_registry.html">Documentation on the registry of NPM packages</a> and the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/5934">original ticket</a> . </p><br><h2 id="podderzhka-api-dlya-integracii-s-kubernetes">  API support for integration with Kubernetes </h2><br><p>  (CORE, STARTER, PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, FREE, BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD) </p><br><p>  In this release, we added API support for integration with Kubernetes.  This means that all actions that are now available in the GUI — adding, deleting and displaying a list of Kubernetes clusters — are now also available through the API.  This gives development teams the ability to create clusters during development. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/625/6ac/20c/6256ac20ca849ce5020fa303ac7ea940.png" alt="API support for Kubernetes integration"></p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/project_clusters.html">API documentation for clusters</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/40473">original ticket</a> . </p><br><h2 id="drugie-uluchsheniya-v-gitlab-117">  Other improvements in GitLab 11.7 </h2><br><h3 id="okno-poiskovogo-filtra-dlya-navigacii-po-doskam-zadach">  Search filter window for navigating task boards </h3><br><p>  (STARTER, PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD) </p><br><p>  Development teams often use multiple task boards, which makes it difficult to navigate the drop-down list if there are too many tasks.  In this release, we added a search filter to solve this problem.  Now you can simply enter a few characters in the search box to quickly reduce the number of tasks to those that are interesting to you, which will greatly simplify navigation. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cab/075/82f/cab07582f6382d491a21d6e660d4301e.png" alt="Search box for issue board navigation"></p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issue_board.html">Documentation on the taskbar</a> and the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/7715">original ticket</a> . </p><br><h3 id="redizayn-spiska-proektov">  Project List Redesign </h3><br><p>  (CORE, STARTER, PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, FREE, BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD) </p><br><p>  Projects are one of the main components of GitLab, so we try to improve the appearance of project lists and simplify working with them. </p><br><p>  In GitLab 11.7, we present a new project list user interface design that focuses on readability and provides a brief report on project activity.

Previously, these features could be used only if your email server supported the sub-addressing feature. </p><br><p>  Starting with this release, GitLab supports both sub-addressing and catch-all mailboxes using the new email format, which allows GitLab to integrate with an even greater number of email servers, including Microsoft Exchange and Google Groups, which do not support sub-addressing. . </p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/incoming_email.html">Documentation for incoming email</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/29951">original ticket</a> . </p><br><h3 id="import-zadach-v-formate-csv">  Import tasks in CSV format </h3><br><p>  (CORE, STARTER, PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, FREE, BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD) </p><br><p>  Often, when development teams start using GitLab, it may turn out that they use different tools and they have inherited data.  Perhaps now you are using Jira, but would like to go to task management in GitLab. </p><br><p>  Starting with this release, this transition becomes much easier.  Since many task tracking systems support exporting CSV files, you can now import such tasks into GitLab, which allows you to continue to work on current tasks, importing the inherited data into GitLab for further searching and retrieval as needed.  It will work with Jira or with any other task tracking system that supports CSV export. </p><br><p>  Also in GitLab there is already a feature for <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/csv_export.html">exporting CSV files</a> . </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3f1/933/8c7/3f19338c75cc5bf8c53f28111efd3e3f.png" alt="Import issues CSV"></p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/csv_import.html">Documentation for importing CSV files</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/49231">original ticket</a> . </p><br><h3 id="generaciya-kratkoy-sha-posledovatelnosti-kak-peremennoy-okruzheniya">  Generating a short SHA sequence as an environment variable </h3><br><p>  (CORE, STARTER, PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, FREE, BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD) </p><br><p>  In Git SHA, pointers to certain objects (for example, commits) in the Git repository are composed of 40 characters.  Often there is no need to display the entire line, and you want only the first eight SHA characters to be shown for quick reference, although this sequence may not be unique.  We added the <code>CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA</code> environment <code>CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA</code> for the CI pipeline to solve this problem, which will allow you to generate the first part of the commit SHA. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/467/5a3/dc0/4675a3dc0ae3d77fcafbdc629cafcd2a.png" alt="Short commit SHA available as environment variable"></p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/">Documentation of environment variables</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/48061">original ticket</a> . </p><br><h3 id="bolee-strogie-ogranicheniya-po-podtverzhdeniyu-svoih-merzh-rekvestov">  More stringent restrictions on confirming your Merge Requests </h3><br><p>  (STARTER, PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD) </p><br><p>  Code review is a practice that should be carried out in any successful project by someone who is not the author of the change.  By default, confirmation of your Merge-Requests is prohibited, but this restriction takes into account the authorship of the Merge-Request, and not the commits included in it. </p><br><p>  Starting with GitLab 11.7, restrictions on confirming their merge-requests will also prevent confirmation of merge-requests by people who have made changes to them, so merger-requests for authorship of several developers will receive completely independent reviews and confirmations. </p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/merge_request_approvals.html">Documentation on the confirmation of merge-requests</a> and the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/3845">original ticket</a> . </p><br><h3 id="podderzhka-avtorizacii-dlya-setevyh-includes">  Authorization support for network includes </h3><br><p>  (CORE, STARTER, PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, FREE, BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD) </p><br><p>  When external files are included in your pipeline definition using the <code>include</code> keyword, these files are requested via HTTP / HTTPS.
