This system is designed for patients with disabilities.  These may be patients of clinics who have suffered a stroke, soldiers with severe injuries, people who have been injured in the workplace. <br><br>  The system developed by domestic specialists is called Neurochat, as <a href="https://www.vesti.ru/doc.html%3Fid%3D2993423">reported</a> by Vesti.  It consists of a headset, which is worn on the head, as well as software that is installed on any desktop PC or laptop.  Neurointerface helps to type on the screen individual words and phrases, which can then be transmitted to the interlocutor.  To facilitate the task, auto text is used. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first batch of devices was sent to several Russian rehabilitation centers.  Serial production, according to the head of the company that develops the system, will begin in late spring or early summer of this year. <br><br>  “The development received the CES Asia award as one of the most interesting and promising products.  At the end of March, we are planning to present a project at the European Neuro Convention (conference on neurotechnologies - ed.) In England.  This will be the first presentation of the finished product to international customers, ”said Alexander Semenov, executive director of the industry alliance of the National Technology Initiative (NTI) NeuroNet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c4f/c60/e6f/c4fc60e6fa2bb34d9f3ab08e941536ee.png"><br><br>  It <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/madrobots/blog/421197/">takes</a> 12 minutes to learn the system, after which it is able to recognize letters on the keyboard, as well as other objects that may be of interest to the user.  Accuracy of typing is about 75%.  In addition to text tasks, the headset can be used in conjunction with various services, including YouTube, search engines, and media resources. <br><br>  An experimental batch of devices amounted to several hundred devices, it was sent for test approbation to several Russian rehabilitation centers at once.  Now there are negotiations on the procurement and supply of this device in the Russian centers.  According to the creators of the device, in the future it may find application in the industry and the entertainment industry, where "there is an interaction of people and machines." </div>
