This “grapefruit” weighing 1.46 kg and 16.5 cm in diameter was the third attempt to launch the Avangard satellite, the second American and the 4th satellite in the world.  And although its batteries failed in <a href="https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do%3Fid%3D1958-002B">June 1958</a> , but he stopped transmitting signals in May 1964 - many other old satellites working for decades and having long and very entertaining stories are in orbit.  About them today will be discussed. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  GPS SVN-23 - 25 years 2 months and 1 day </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sh/yd/gg/shydggyl5pszaiqbz-5-r0boe4m.jpeg"><br><br>  Launched on November 26, 1990 and launched into the required orbit on December 30, the GPS satellite also known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA-66">USA-66</a> worked in a group until December 2004, when it was transferred to the reserve.  At that time, it was almost twice as long as its warranty period (which was 7.5 years), but in February 2008 it was decided to bring it back into operation.  As a result, he worked until January 25, 2016, when he was transferred to a grave orbit and finally disconnected.  At the moment of its shutdown, the software bug caused the shutdown of all remaining 15 GPS satellites for 13.7 microseconds. <br><br><h4>  Landsat 5 - 29 years 3 months and 4 days </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5p/g8/cw/5pg8cwzjxfi5qzvbhyg3m8eu2l8.jpeg"><br><br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landsat-5">Landsat 5</a> became the oldest explorer of the Earth - launched on March 1, 1984, it took more than 2.5 million images of the Earth before the end of 2012, when one of its gyroscopes failed.  The satellite still had 2 working gyros, which were enough for work - but the mission leadership decided not to risk it and turn off the device.  He took the last pictures on January 6, 2013, and after 9 days went to the burial orbit.  The mission of the device ended on June 5, 2013, when the device ran out of fuel and was given the command to turn off all systems. <br><br>  The device was proposed to be returned to Earth with the help of Shuttles, but this required leaving a lot of fuel to reduce the orbit (Shuttles could not get to its working orbit).  However, in the end, it was decided to spend the remaining fuel to extend his mission.  On February 10, 2013, he entered the Guinness Book of Records as the longest-used satellite to monitor the earth.  It is assumed that it will enter the dense layers of the atmosphere in 2034. <br><br><h4>  IMP-8 - 32 years 11 months and 11 days </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ev/ny/jw/evnyjwt_qyfnaudia5070dkjreq.jpeg"><br><br>  The oldest scientific satellite in terrestrial orbit: launched on October 26, 1973 with a planned duration of 10 years, it worked until <a href="https://spdf.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/data/imp/imp8/documents/archived_website/project.html">October 7, 2006</a> .

On the satellite, cameras of the visible and infrared spectrum were installed to observe the clouds, wind, and surface temperature on the day / night side of the Earth.  The satellite was located in a geosynchronous orbit, and its stabilization was carried out by rotation, so that the satellite could observe the Earth less than 10% of the total time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mv/sg/zp/mvsgzprtudrrxzatulibaerc-ta.gif"><br>  <i>Picture of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582-%25D0%25A5%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581_1980_%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0">1980</a> St. Helens <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582-%25D0%25A5%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581_1980_%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0">eruption</a> <a href="http://itg1.meteor.wisc.edu/wxwise/museum/a3/a3volcan.html">made by</a> GOES 3</i> <br><br>  In 1988, his cameras were out of order, and he lost the opportunity to work as intended, but retained the ability to communicate with the land.

In this role, he worked until June 15, 2016, when it was decided to permanently disable it.

Voyager 1 and 2 have already moved away from the Sun by 21.1 and 17.5 billion km, and continue to move away (Voyager 1 should move away from us on 1 holy day by 2027).  Recently, Voyager-1 <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/296081/">turned on</a> its engines after 37 years and 20 days of inactivity — this was necessary in order to save some more energy required for the operation of gyroscopes.  Perhaps the Voyagers will be able to maintain their performance until 2036 - thus, Voyager-2 may also reach a distance of 1 sv.  a day in working condition, as well as will last 59 years - thereby setting a record that is almost impossible to beat.  In general, you can write about Voyagers <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/292209/">almost infinitely</a> . <br><br><h4>  AMSAT-OSCAR-7 - 43 years 4 months and 2 days </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ge/cx/yw/gecxywcks30txsf2zyxyiqypchs.jpeg"><br>  <i>Satellite on the vibration stand</i> <br><br>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMSAT-OSCAR_7">AMSAT-OSCAR-7</a> is the oldest communication and amateur satellite: launched on November 15, 1974, it lost its batteries in 1981, and since then it interrupts its work when the Sun does not shine on its solar panels (this happens when the orbit is in the shadow of the Earth, which happens in summer and autumn), but he himself has retained the ability to work until now.  In addition to communication by radio amateurs, in the summer of 1982 it was also used by the Polish anti-communist movement <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%258E%25D1%2589%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F%25D1%2581%25D1%258F_%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C">“Fighting Solidarity”</a> since, since December of the previous year, due to the introduction of martial law, ordinary telephone communication was tapped, and ordinary amateur stations were easily spotted.

Due to the failure of the acceleration stage, this satellite, launched as early as February 11, 1965, remained in a circular orbit at 2,800 km instead of an elliptical orbit at 2,800x15,000 km, but this did not prevent experiments with it during the next 2 years.  However, then the connection with him was lost, and in the period from 1967 to 2013, he was silent until one radio amateur caught his signal at 237 MHz. <br><br><h4>  Transit 5B-5 - 53 years 3 months and 4 days </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/r1/jo/eh/r1joehmozz_z0lvkw4u2f_tpi4i.jpeg"><br><br>  Refers to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit_(satellite)">Transit series of</a> navigation satellites intended for the US Navy.

However, despite the fact that the connection with him was impossible, he still continues to transmit telemetry at a frequency of 136.65 MHz, which, if desired, <a href="https://www.rtl-sdr.com/receiving-dead-satellites-rtl-sdr/">can be detected</a> .  Due to the fact that his batteries and RITEG have not worked for a long time, communication with him is possible only when the Sun shines on him. <br><br><h4>  Russian satellites </h4><br>  I thought it would be interesting for everyone to find out how these world achievements relate to what we managed to achieve.
