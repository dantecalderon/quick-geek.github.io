<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the fantastic action movie <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%258B_(%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BC)">“Surrogates”</a> , the world is shown, where people go to work, shop or date not themselves, but with the help of robots, staying at home.  The future has already come: a Japanese startup offers you to use other people with a tablet on your face for remote presence. <br><br><div class="oembed"><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-0" style="position: absolute; visibility: hidden; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg); width: 500px; margin: 10px auto; max-width: 100%; min-width: 220px;"></twitter-widget><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" data-twitter-extracted-i1551254907864322206="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">  “Human Uber,” developed in Japan, provides a way to attend events remotely using another person's body.  “It's surprisingly natural” says its inventor, Jin Rekimoto of Sony <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/emtechasia%3Fsrc%3Dhash%26ref_src%3Dtwsrc%255Etfw">#emtechasia</a> <a href="https://t.co/WZHPVcZ6M0">pic.twitter.com/WZHPVcZ6M0</a> </p>  - will knight (@willknight) <a href="https://twitter.com/willknight/status/958231499509149697%3Fref_src%3Dtwsrc%255Etfw">January 30, 2018</a> </blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At the <a href="http://emtechasia.com/">EmTech</a> conference, which was held in Singapore on January 30-31, a Japanese startup presented the <a href="https://sway.com/W8bS6GnxX2_DMDea">ChameleonMask</a> technology "Human Uber".  The person in this case plays the role of a remote presence robot.  The client sees what is happening with the help of the camera, his face is displayed on the tablet attached to the artist’s head, and the voice is heard through the device’s speaker.  How exactly the performer sees where to go is not written on the site, but it can be assumed that with the help of a virtual reality helmet he sees the same as the client. <br><br>  The developers conducted several field studies.  Experiments provided communication grandmother with a grandson, walked around the city with the face of the character anime and Lady Gaga.  The tests showed that people perceive the "human Uber" as the person whose face is displayed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/i3/9p/rk/i39prkrrdv8vgwzkrrthjokc1oy.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/eh/je/r2/ehjer2nkmgwpjbfc0xow9fwexgc.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dp/he/ke/dphekeunepabwhoy4gv1tkpml_y.jpeg"><br><br>  This is not surprising: telepresence robots have been used in schools for a long time - children who are sick for a long time can attend classes with their help.  They "raise their hand" with the help of blinking LEDs, communicate with teachers and classmates.  This practice has been <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3063627/telepresence-robots-for-sick-kids-are-so-effective-they-even-get-bullied">investigated</a> in the United States in terms of the perception of these children by their peers.  It turned out that the students perceived the robot so well as a real person who controls it, that even their harassment (bullying) <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/290413/">took place</a> .  One of the girls was called a vacuum cleaner, and the boy had a ketchup screen splashed <s>into his face</s> with the words “What, will you complain to mommy?”. <br><br>  Will the effect in the case of using a person instead of a robot deeper, show further research.  The developers also want to find the answer to the question: what is a human person if we separate its face from the body? <br><br><div class="oembed"><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-1" style="position: absolute; visibility: hidden; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg); width: 500px; margin: 10px auto; max-width: 100%; min-width: 220px;"></twitter-widget><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" data-twitter-extracted-i1551254907864322206="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">  <a href="https://twitter.com/rkmt%3Fref_src%3Dtwsrc%255Etfw">@rkmt</a> giving the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/emtechasia%3Fsrc%3Dhash%26ref_src%3Dtwsrc%255Etfw">#emtechasia</a> audience a peek into the emerging <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AR%3Fsrc%3Dhash%26ref_src%3Dtwsrc%255Etfw">world</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VR%3Fsrc%3Dhash%26ref_src%3Dtwsrc%255Etfw">#am</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/immersivemedia%3Fsrc%3Dhash%26ref_src%3Dtwsrc%255Etfw">#VR</a> <a href="https://t.co/iQzAc4lys9">#immersivemedia pic.twitter.com/iQzAc4lys</a> </p>  - EmTech Asia (@EmTechAsia) <a href="https://twitter.com/EmTechAsia/status/958239134669201409%3Fref_src%3Dtwsrc%255Etfw">January 30, 2018</a> </blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br>  One of the markets for the service could be nursing homes and medical facilities.  Telepresence robots <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/smileexpo/blog/295693/">give positive emotions</a> , help to communicate with children, family, friends.  Perhaps soon in the same way it will be possible to send the service employee nearest to her grandmother to come in and talk to her, sitting face to face.  Or you can help your friends with the move by hiring a surrogate with your build.  No one will notice anything. </div>
