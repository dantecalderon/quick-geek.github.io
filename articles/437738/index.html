  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Notes phytochemist. Potatoes. Part two. The story about potato fat or "Day of the Syroyid"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I think the regular readers of my notes have already noticed my rather skeptical attitude to all kinds of, if I may say so, food and nutritional deviations, such as raw food, mono-learning, and prano-studies (‚Äúthousands of them‚Äù).  But today I want to talk about such "nutrients" of potatoes, which in most cases are available only to those who use raw potatoes (or make potato juice) and will not bring special benefit to "cookers and cookers of all stripes" (to whom by the way, and the author of these lines).  There should be a holiday on Syroeda Street.  This day has come ... <br><br>  In general, to find out how to cure arthritis with potatoes and lower blood pressure, what size the potato genome has and where potato kvass is produced now, you need to look under the cut. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cm/fm/l8/cmfml8qhkvhdrryv3-yjdbympp0.jpeg"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>- Biochemistry!</i>  <i>Biochemistry!</i>  <i>- shouted the pioneers and got notebooks.</i> <br>  <b>paraphrased from a famous joke</b> <br><br><h3>  Bulbyan tlushch, he's Fat of the ... potato </h3><br>  Speaking frankly, to introduce such a thing as ‚Äúpotato fat‚Äù even somehow not <i>comme il faut</i> , because the fat content (they are lipids) in tubers is very low - only about 0.2 - 2 grams / kg wet weight (or <a href="https://www.oecd.org/env/ehs/biotrack/46815167.pdf">an average of</a> 1.2 g / kg).  My favorite <a href="https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/nutrients/index">base of the USDA</a> speaks about the same, attributing 100 grams of boiled potatoes to 0.1 grams of lipids, of which 0.03 grams comes from saturated fatty acids, 0.002 to monounsaturated fatty acids and 0.043 grams of polyunsaturated fatty acids.  And this is despite the fact that for a healthy adult organism, up to about 17 grams of omega-6 and up to 2 grams of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are required per day.  In general, it can be said for sure that it will not be possible to make profit from potatoes ... But in general, not everything is so simple, because we are looking for quality, not quantity. <br><br>  To begin with, surprisingly, all lipids are synthesized in potato tubers from sucrose.  Under the spoiler for advanced readers - <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15014998">biosynthesis scheme</a> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Synthesis of starch and fats in potatoes</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Sucrose is converted to UDP-glucose and fructose in tuber cells using sucrose synthetase.  Most of the carbohydrates enter plant amyloplast and are used to produce ADP glucose, the precursor to starch synthesis.  A small amount of carbohydrates is metabolized by glycolysis or is converted to acetyl CoA and malonyl CoA for the synthesis of fatty acids in the same amyloplast.  Fatty acyl groups are transferred by specialized proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum, where they are subsequently used for lipid biosynthesis. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4r/ui/gm/4ruigmsfwfcgpk5dqeccqvjcyy0.jpeg"></div><br>  Designations: ACCase - Acetyl-CoA carboxylase, AGP - ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, ACP - carrier protein for acyl groups, AATP - plastid ATP / ADP transporter, bP - bisphosphate, CoA - coenzyme A, DAG - diacylglycerol, diacylglycerol, DAP, diaphosphate, DA - diaphosphate, CoA - D, - DAC is a carrier protein for acyl groups, ACP. CoA - diacylglycerol acyltransferase, Frc - fructose, Glc - glucose, P - phosphate, PGM - plastid phosphoglucomutase, TAG - triglycerides <br></div></div><br>  Free fatty acids and triglycerides in potatoes are trace amounts, but there are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15453705">phospholipids</a> (phosphatidylcholine - 30.7 mol.%, Phosphatidyl ethanolamine - 19.6%, phosphatidyl inositol - 9.3%, phosphatidyl acid - 3.2%, phosphatidylserine - 1 , 5%, phosphatidylglycerol - 1.2% and diphosphatidylglycerol ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD">cardiolipin</a> ) - 0.7%) and galactolipids.  If I have already talked about phospholipids and their properties in the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/434406/">Fat of the ... banana</a> section <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/434406/">of</a> my latest "banana" article (and this means that everything said there applies to potatoes), I will briefly tell you about galactolipids now.  In fact, it is a kind of glycolipids, substances containing in their composition a non-polar ‚Äútail‚Äù - a lipid residue (fatty acid), linked by a covalent (glycosidic) bond with a polar carbohydrate residue (literally sugar ‚Äúhead‚Äù).  In the case of galactolipids, galactose acts as a carbohydrate residue. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7l/tx/tc/7ltxtcljl57atr-y9xzbxr6j9hc.jpeg"></div><br>  In general, glycolipids are responsible for the stability of the cell membrane and for the recognition of ‚Äúfriend or foe‚Äù, both the underlying immune response and the cells that allow them to grow together, forming tissues.  In addition, glycolipids are located on the surface of the membranes of eukaryotic cells, extending from the double lipid layer into the "open space" of the extracellular environment.  Returning to the galactolipids, we can say that most often they are directly involved in the processes of photosynthesis and act as a backup "analog" of phospholipids, in case of a lack of phosphorus in the body.  In addition to the fact that galactolipids have a greater bioavailability than free fatty acids, they are also able to show good anti-inflammatory activity.  As an example, there can be wild rose, containing galactolipids and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1408943">having a</a> pronounced anti-inflammatory effect (anti-arthritis, in particular). <br><br>  An interesting fact is that galactolipids can also act as a scaring agent (anti-fidget) for marine plants (as well as all sorts of tannins for terrestrial).  An example is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fucus_vesiculosus">Fucus</a> algae that is widespread on the coasts of the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean, which the cutest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbacia_punctulata">sea ‚Äã‚Äãhedgehog</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%252Fs00442-003-1242-3">cannot</a> eat because of the presence of galactolipids. <br><br>  According to the lengths of the fat-related compounds present in the tubers: <br><br>  <u>Firstly</u> , these are phytosterols already known to us (see the article <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/434406/">Phytochemist Notes. The decline of the habr-banana era</a> to refresh knowledge of phytosterols / sterols).  In fresh potato tubers, you can find a lot of free sterols.  Fresh potato tubers contain about 43.1‚Äì43.7% Œ≤-sitosterol (of the total number of plant sterols), campesterol (26%), Œî5-avenasterin (20%), and 10% of the residue is approximately equally divided between the brassicasterin, Œî7-avenasterin and stigmasterine and their esters.  So what?  So subj is wrong ( <s>why - see the banana article already mentioned above</s> ): <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/x2/ti/wf/x2tiwftmiegobxjvvctrorumdws.jpeg"></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">But why do you eat this meat with a bull and go to bed?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  And then, that the phytosterols of the bulba reduce the absorption of cholesterol meat, not with a banana, this meat is long-suffering, I swear, to eat ... <br></div></div><br>  <u>Secondly</u> , the lipophilic biopolymer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suberin">suberin</a> , which is the main component of the inner part of the potato skins.  Suberin consists of the so-called.  suberic acids (cork acids) and glycerin.  The acids themselves are sometimes used to synthesize drugs ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582">such</a> as those reported by the Russian Wikipedia) and biodegradable plastics.  And suberin - suberin, friends, this, roughly speaking, is the same cork, absolutely the same in the wine bottle, which is in the form of finishing material on the kitchen wall.  ‚ÄúRoughly speaking‚Äù because a cork is a mixture of suberin, fiber, lignin and various plant waxes. <br><br>  <u>And thirdly</u> , it is the fats that are responsible for the very potato smell.  It is important that raw potatoes have almost no odor, because they contain very small amounts of volatile substances.  As soon as the oxidation of lipids has gone - odors have gone as well (by the way, it is with the processes of lipid oxidation that all antioxidants fight).  The pleasant smells of freshly boiled potatoes, as well as roasted and baked, are formed due to the fact that the oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids (which contain that scanty amount) occurs - mainly linoleic and linolenic.  As a result <a href="">, a</a> number of volatile aldehydes, ketones, alcohols and alkyl furanes are formed.  According to the authors of the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15453705">work</a> , the difference in tastes of boiled potatoes of different varieties is related to the content of linoleic acid, and the <i>cis-4-heptenal compound</i> , which is formed as a result of oxidation (the compound is, by the way, used as food flavor).  As a fly in the ointment, you can add that unpleasant odors ("rancidity", etc.) also owe their appearance to unsaturated fatty acids, which are easily oxidized during storage (especially dehydrated potatoes and products from it).  In this <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16848530">paper, the</a> authors showed that the unpleasant odor that is formed during long-term storage of potato flakes, the latter are due to the decomposition products of linoleic acid (formed during the splitting of linoleic acid peroxo-complexes), in particular, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexanal">hexanal</a> (which gives the smell of "freshly cut grass"). <br><br>  I suspect that commentators necessarily at the mention of the smell of thermally processed potatoes can recall all sorts of pyrazines, which give the potato "the very taste familiar from childhood."  Therefore, I‚Äôll make a clarification ‚Äúfor smell, fats are more responsible, and taste is everything else that results from the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D1%258F%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0">Maillard‚Äôs reaction,</a> known to every chef.‚Äù <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xo/5y/ts/xo5ytslizv42ip8pcpctzdlbqzk.png"></div><br><blockquote>  Maillard reaction (sugar-condensation reaction) is a chemical reaction between amino acids and sugars that occurs when heated.  An example of such a reaction is roasting meat or baking bread, during which a typical smell, color and taste of cooked food arises in the process of heating a food product.  These changes are caused by the formation of Maillard reaction products.  Named in honor of the French chemist and physician Louis Camille Maillard, who was one of the first to investigate the reaction in the 1910s. </blockquote>  It may be necessary later to stop separately on the process of heat treatment of potatoes and consider its chemistry.  In the meantime, I‚Äôll just say that the formation of the taste of cooked / fried potatoes (and its inherent flavor) is mainly due to the various alkyl furanes (pyrazines to the same), which are formed in the very Maillard reaction. <br><br>  <u>To the note</u> : an interesting fact is that the decay products of RNA - some ribonucleotides formed in the process of baking / frying potatoes act as precursors (precursors) of ‚Äúglutamate-like‚Äù flavor enhancers, stimulators of the ‚Äú <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A3%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8">umami</a> ‚Äù class receptors.  So, if ‚Äúthe language does not go to glutamate, glutamate goes to the language,‚Äù and you,% USERNAME%, cannot even guess about it :) <br><br><h3>  Potato protein </h3><br>  Fat - little, protein - a little more (in potatoes, of course).  But all the same, even with a great desire to reach for animal products will not work.  On average, one potato tuber contains about 20 grams of protein (6.9-46.3) per kilogram of green weight.  And according to the USDA, the pulp of a single uncooked potato contains approximately 1.87 grams of protein per 100 g of product.  Thus, the protein that can enter the body with potatoes is a tiny part of the total daily protein intake for the body.  But, nevertheless, it is necessary to recognize that even with such a low content, root vegetables (such as potatoes and sweet potatoes) are a valuable non-grain source of protein on a global scale.  In addition, potato protein is of particular value due to the high content of essential acids such as lysine, methionine, threonine and tryptophan.  Yet, so to speak, endogenous proteins that can be found in potatoes can be divided into three classes: patatins, protease inhibitors and high-molecular proteins.  About each detail below. <br><br>  <u>The main protein</u> found in potatoes is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patatin">patatin</a> , also known as <i>tuberin</i> (as it will turn out in Russian, ‚Äúpotatoes‚Äù or something ...). It is mainly found in tubers or plant <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD">stolons</a> (in vacuoles of the parenchyma). On patatins about 40‚Äì60% of all potato proteins account for. Patatins are reserve-type glycoproteins (ie, proteins accumulated during the growth and development of the fetus as nutrients necessary for the development of a plant in the initial stages of germination), having lipidacyl hydrolase enzyme activity ( L  AH, capable of cleaving fatty acids from membrane lipids, but this, by the way, is the main cause of allergy to potatoes) and has a molecular weight of 40 to 45 kDa. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ak/9-/ty/ak9-tyxsyebv67kttn9u-9ilzw4.png"></div><br>  Patatin consists of about 366 amino acids, is present in potatoes as a dimer with a molecular weight of about 88 kDa.  The tertiary structure of a protein is stable up to 45 ¬∞ C, with an increase in temperature, the secondary structure begins to unfold and at 55 ¬∞ C denatures the Œ±-helix.  So, rejoice, O admirers and fans of the now fashionable <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B2_%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2583%25D1%2583%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5">SU-KID flow</a> , even it can save you from potato protein. <br><br>  Interestingly, compared to other common proteinaceous plant sources, patatin has the same nutritional efficiency as egg white, and at the same time has emulsifying properties better than soy proteins ( <s>producers of various vegetarian surrogates should stop and think about it</s> ). <br><br>  <u>The second group of</u> potato <u>proteins</u> are protease inhibitors (so-called tuberinin), which have a molecular weight in the range from 5 to 25 kDa.  Like patatin, protease inhibitors account for 30‚Äì40% of total tuber protein.  And yes, this is if someone has already forgotten, as much as <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/434944/">anti-nutrients</a> .  Protease inhibitors block the work of serine, cysteine ‚Äã‚Äã(inhibits papain = do not eat raw potatoes with papaya), aspartic protease (can inhibit trypsin, chymotrypsin and elastase of human leukocytes, aha), some invertases and metal-containing carboxypepsida (PCI).  In general, today there are five families of these inhibitors (A - with a mass of up to 8.1 kDa, B - with a mass of up to 12.3 kDa, C - with a mass of 22‚Äì25 kDa, K, M), which differ in their amino acid sequence , chain length and composition of the subunit (from monomer to pentamer).  70% of potato protease inhibitors belong to the so-called.  " <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunitz_domain">Domains Kunits</a> " (stress on the first syllable), which, by the way, are actively used as the basis for the development of new pharmaceutical products.  Compared with patatin, protease inhibitors are generally more hydrophilic, however, both protein fractions have the same tendency to coagulate under the influence of heat treatment (i.e., they are also vulnerable to <i><a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B2_%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2583%25D1%2583%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5">sous-vide</a></i> ).  Once again I remind you that protease inhibitors received the status of anti-nutritional substances because they decrease the digestibility and biological value of protein, which, however, takes place only when raw or improperly prepared potato products are consumed. <br><br>  And finally, the <u>third, ‚ÄúNONAME‚Äù</u> , a group of potato proteins (20‚Äì30% of the total potato protein).  This includes mainly high-molecular proteins involved in the synthesis of starch, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031942200885064">such</a> as phosphorylase L-1 with a molecular mass of 80 kDa (4%).  You can also recall lipoxygenase (10%), defensin (5%), annexin, glyoxylase I, enolase, catalase, UDP-pyrophosphorylase, etc.  Nobody has really <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12475285">studied</a> this family yet.  So there are still white spots <s>(Belarusian potato experts, ay! Work for you)</s> . <br><br>  So, the description is given and worth telling, but what is all this interesting.  And it is interesting that during the enzymatic degradation of many of the mentioned polypeptides, short-chain proteins are formed, which may have hormone-like (antithrombotic, antihypertensive, immunomodulating, etc.) activity.  Peptides with 3‚Äì20 amino acid residues that are able to penetrate the intestinal epithelium or bind to specific receptors of intestinal epithelial cells usually have bioactivity. <br><br>  Today, it is necessary to recognize that neither the physiological role nor the biological activity of potato proteins has been studied sufficiently (read waiting for its researchers).  Based on the amino acid sequences of potato proteins, the researchers suggest the presence of several potential ‚Äúprecursor proteins‚Äù (precursors) that form peptides with different activity in the human body. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Lyrics about potato genome and potato kvass from Belarus</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  I don‚Äôt know how many people know, but the potato genome has already been deciphered.  And you can even download it, burn it to DVD-R and give it to your grandmother, from which in the fall we will carry a couple of bags ... Fortunately, it only takes 844 MB (this is not a <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6403/eaar7191">wheat</a> genome about 15 GB in size, and all sorts of genomes of <a href="">peas</a> , <a href="">strawberries</a> , <a href="">cocoa</a> , <a href="">cucumber</a> , <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08670">soybeans</a> , etc., etc. are also not small in size).  It clearly looks something like this: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rf/x8/qp/rfx8qpqwtpdtbdjk88q1q81od8y.jpeg"></div><br>  The picture, by the way, from that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature10158">legendary article</a> in no less legendary Nature.  The potato genome was sequenced in 2011 by the International Potato Sequencing Consortium.  The structure of this team included 16 scientific groups from different countries, there were specialists from Russia, but I don‚Äôt know if they were from the ‚Äúpotato‚Äù Belarus - if the commentators prompt, I‚Äôll correct the article. <br><br>  But most likely, while the international community is sequenced, sequenced, and not engraved, our brother ‚Äúwashed and rolled‚Äù (= grandfather Michurin bequeathed to us) brought out to himself selection methods of ‚Äú <a href="https://www.bbc.com/russian/society/2014/08/140811_coloured_potatoes_belarus">potatoes with pink, blue and violet flesh</a> ‚Äù.

The age of these tubers also affected (lovers of young potatoes, whatever one may say, but they are right in their taste preferences). <br><br>  Although, if we talk about lowering blood pressure, then it is worth mentioning such a thing as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kukoamines">cucoamines</a> (in the picture - cucoamine A) <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sx/_q/3n/sx_q3nxen3xawybthpcl4275tsk.jpeg"></div><br>  In 2005, British researchers <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15969534">discovered</a> these compounds in potatoes.  Chemically, cucoamines are catechins (ie, belong to a subset of antioxidants), as well as derivatives of dihydro cofeic acid diamines.  Previously, such compounds were found in a single plant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycium_chinense">Lycium chinense</a> (Solanaceae) aka Dereza Chinese <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ci/iu/us/ciiuusllczw7sevmubsckmvmyuo.jpeg"></div><br>  If anything, Dereza ordinary belongs to the same <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0">family</a> , the fruits of which are also called ‚Äúwolf berries‚Äù in our country.  But there is no system here, so do not even think about grabbing wolfberry at your leisure, the pressure will not drop, despite the external similarity (find ten differences with Lycium chinense) <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ye/9s/n2/ye9sn2gn9tsgsc3ekuai89guc6q.jpeg"></div><br>  Chinese wolfberry has traditionally been used in phytomedicine, as a means of effectively reducing blood pressure.  Similar properties have the potato cokeamine.  True, it is worth noting that in the same work in 2005 there are references to studies showing the presence of cucoamines in forest tobacco (Nicotiana sylvestris) and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum).  While the role of cucoamines in potatoes is not well understood, there are articles where the authors attribute to them the regulation of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0981942806000246">starch biosynthesis</a> , the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15695456">formation of resistance to diseases</a> and the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC426220/">stimulation of germination</a> .  As for the biological activity in the human body, there is still to assess the thermal stability of potato amines (and today there are about 30 of them) and their bioavailability. <br><br>  The second interesting fact of protein nature can serve as work (a, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18211011">two</a> ).  The researchers found that potato proteins, in particular, aspartic protease inhibitors, stimulate the release of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A5%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD">cholestokinin</a> (CCK) in mice and stimulate cells that produce CCKAR (English Cholecystokinin A receptor), which, interacting with food proteins, contributes to the appearance of saturation. <br><br>  Considering all of the above, potato proteins can act as an excellent component for creating functional food (I mentioned it repeatedly in my ‚Äúbanana‚Äù articles). <br><br>  In addition, potatoes, due to the huge amount of virtually free polypeptides, can act as an excellent in vitro nanoreactor of many necessary biological compounds.  Researchers at <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18391469">work</a> , for example, found that small potato peptides obtained by alkaline enzymatic hydrolysis had a positive effect on lipid metabolism in rats.  As a result of this work, the high molecular weight proteins of the potato were able to be ‚Äúcrushed‚Äù into peptides with a molecular weight from 700 to 1840 Da, and the basic molecular weight (90% of the total) was 850 Da.  As a result, it was concluded that such a method of obtaining low molecular weight peptides is the most economically available from existing, with excellent opportunities for industrial scaling (not to mention the fact that low molecular weight peptides have a wider range of functional properties than their high-molecular "colleagues"). <br><br>  What is this all about?  And the fact that today potato protein is most often tried to be removed during the production of starch and is not even always used for animal feed (because of the bitter taste that some compounds can produce, the same solanine), potato proteins are also not used for emulsification and foaming, although, I think, everyone who has cooked potatoes at least once knows how stable the foam produced during boiling can be.  And the thing comes out is an interesting and not enough studied.  Their only disadvantage is that all the most interesting properties appear only when using as is, i.e.  in raw form ... Chemists, raw foodists, your turn! <br><br>  <b>To be continued...</b> <br><br>  <b>Sergey Besarab</b> ( <a href="https://www.facebook.com/steanlab">Siarhei V.
