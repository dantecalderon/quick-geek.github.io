<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  After several launches of the launch today, the second launch of the ultra-light Electron rocket took place.  This time the rocket successfully reached orbit and brought out three satellites - one Dove and two Lemur-2. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vm/go/qg/vmgoqggreeqtyo-_r0ifeod_3pm.jpeg"><br>  <i>Photo: Rocket Labs</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The second copy of the rocket was taken to the start several times.  Back in December, the first attempt prevented the wind.  The second time the launch systems were not set up under too warm weather (it is summer in New Zealand), and liquid oxygen overheated in tanks.  At the third attempt the wind again prevented.  And the fourth time there was a failure in the power supply.  The launch was postponed to January, and people were sent to rest.  On January 20, a new nine-day launch window opened, but for the first time only reached the twelve minute readiness.  But on Sunday morning, the rocket finally launched.  The company did not regret its PR resources, so there was a webcast and high-quality on-board cameras (starting at 14:50). <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eg5234BOED8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Payload operators have already <a href="https://twitter.com/planetlabs/status/954895354360512513">confirmed the</a> presence of satellites in orbits and their performance. <br><br><h2>  Materiel </h2><br>  Electron launch vehicle belongs to the ultralight class and can put 150 kilograms of cargo into a polar orbit 500 km high.  The rocket's special feature is the electric drive of fuel pumps, the extensive use of 3D printing and composite materials, as well as a new word in logistics - the delivery of the head fairing to the customerâ€™s workshop.

Due to the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/291999/">incorrect configuration of the ground equipment, they</a> stopped receiving telemetry from the rocket and gave the command to abort the flight. <br><br><h2>  Future </h2><br>  The company's activity is increasing - <a href="https://twitter.com/RocketLab/status/953734300188393473">a</a> picture of fire tests of the second stage of the third launch vehicle <a href="https://twitter.com/RocketLab/status/953734300188393473">appeared</a> on Twitter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fe/id/nm/feidnmaxvmgvazakz-j4dxcebam.jpeg"><br>  <i>Photo Rocket Labs</i> <br><br>  There were also published photos of the engines for the fourth instance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/55/ip/pl/55ipplbhj5h0v79fixi0oxkkukm.jpeg"><br>  <i>Photo Rocket Labs</i> <br><br>  Good luck to the new launch services operator. </div>
