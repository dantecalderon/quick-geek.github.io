CMS for January 2019. In the digest: information about Joomla 4, news about Joomla, a selection of links to tools for developers and webmasters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ot/uu/bt/otuubtzpl9rzxhoxnw048lzukbk.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The official <a href="https://joomlaportal.ru/news/translations/2925-obnovlenie-lokalizatsii-dlya-joomla-3-9">Russian localization of Joomla 3.9 has been released</a> .  In connection with the addition of tools for working with personal data, the amount of translation was quite large.  For the release of localization a new team of localizers was assembled and because of this, the release was delayed for a month. <br><br>  <a href="https://joomlaportal.ru/news/translations/2925-obnovlenie-lokalizatsii-dlya-joomla-3-9">Joomla 3.9.2 released</a> .  It should be noted that Joomla 3.9 turned out to be a relatively trouble-free update, despite the fact that the update itself was quite large.  I recall from the release of 3.9, the system fully complies with GDRP. <br><br><img alt="en" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/2e2/522/737/2e2522737ec404a9f76047e108dfaea0.gif">  <a href="https://www.joomla.org/announcements/release-news/5755-joomla-3-9-2-release.html">Original news</a> . <br><br>  I recommend watching the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D2lxe5iDzyXs">video review of</a> tools for working with personal data in Russian. <br><br>  Due to the unplanned release of Joomla 3.9, the release of the remaining versions of Joomla was shifted and plans to support the 3.x branch were revised.  The latest version of the 3.x branch will be Joomla 3.10.  More information can be found on the <a href="https://cmscafe.ru/novosti/998-joomla-3-10-i-joomla-4-0">link</a> .  It also outlines plans for developing Joomla 4 and the reasons why you still need to release another major update of the 3.x line. <br><br><h3>  Joomla 4 selection </h3><br>  Many years ago, Bootstrap 2 was chosen to build the administrative panel of Joomla 3. Then it was decided to use this framework at the front.  We are reaping the unpleasant consequences of such a decision so far - despite the fact that the use of Bootstrap 2 on the front can be turned off, many templates come out with the support of an outdated framework. <br><br>  Joomla 4 will not have such a problem.  However, Joomla admin panel will be built on the basis of Bootstrap 4. In this article you can read about the advantages of CSS Grid when designing Joomla templates.  An interesting look at this in the article: <br><br><img alt="en" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/2e2/522/737/2e2522737ec404a9f76047e108dfaea0.gif">  <a href="https://www.joomlashack.com/blog/joomla-news/css-grid/">The future of Joomla is CSS Grid and not Bootstrap 4 at all</a> . <br><br>  In Joomla 3.7, the fields appeared out of the box, they developed in the framework of Joomla 3, for example, in Joomla 3.9, the multipole appeared (repeatable fields).  The fields will continue to grow in Joomla 4. <br><br><img alt="en" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/2e2/522/737/2e2522737ec404a9f76047e108dfaea0.gif">  <a href="https://www.joomdev.com/blog/entry/custom-fields-in-joomla-4">Article overview of the fields in Joomla 4</a> . <br><br><h3>  A selection of interesting facts about Joomla </h3><br>  <a href="https://jpath.ru/jobs">jpath.ru/jobs</a> - A job search resource for Joomla has been launched.  Here you can place an ad for a job search and if your application is approved, it will be published on the website and on social networks. <br><br><img alt="en" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/2e2/522/737/2e2522737ec404a9f76047e108dfaea0.gif">  <a href="https://www.joomlashack.com/blog/joomla/custom-category-layout/">How to create your own blog layouts in Joomla</a> .  Content types in Joomla have been around since Joomla 2.5, but few people know about it and use it in their work.  This article contains detailed instructions on how to create your content type. <br><br><img alt="en" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/2e2/522/737/2e2522737ec404a9f76047e108dfaea0.gif">  <a href="https://hostingtribunal.com/blog/joomla-statistics/">General Joomla statistics for 2019</a> .  I recommend to get acquainted with it, even if you are not working with this CMS. <br><br><img alt="en" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/2e2/522/737/2e2522737ec404a9f76047e108dfaea0.gif">  <a href="https://twitter.com/joomla/status/1085889434803937280">There are a hundred million</a> !  In January, the official Twitter Joomla published an interesting note: Joomla downloads from the official site exceeded 100,000,000. By the way, it is noteworthy that downloads from Github are not included in this figure. <br><br>  This is news from last year, but we could not pass by as part of the first issue of the digest.  Joomla received the nomination ‚Äú <a href="https://www.cmscritic.com/awards/">Best Free CMS</a> ‚Äù from CMS Critic.  Surprisingly, for all the years of participation in this award, Joomla consistently received the award "Best CMS". <br><br>  I do not know if doctoral dissertations are written on other CMS, but this is the first about Joomla. <br><br><img alt="en" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/2e2/522/737/2e2522737ec404a9f76047e108dfaea0.gif">  <a href="">Doctoral dissertation, the case for which is the Joomla</a> : <a href="">Joomla</a> : Joomla. <br><br><h3>  Joomla and e-commerce </h3><br>  In this section, we will once a month talk about any component for commerce on Joomla.  The goal is to show a variety of solutions.  The fact is that the extensions for e-commerce in Joomla are phenomenal, only in JED (Joomla extensions catalog) in the category of online stores more than 20 full-fledged components. <br><br>  Today we have <a href="https://www.phoca.cz/phocacart">Phoca Cart</a> . <br><br>  A very young store that was released at the end of 2017.

The developer himself offers 9 <a href="https://www.phoca.cz/phocacart-extensions/3-templates">free site templates</a> for his component. <br><br>  An overview of this component in Russian can be read <a href="https://cmscafe.ru/novosti/932-phoca-cart-3-0-0-besplatnyj-komponent-internet-magazina-dlya-joomla">here</a> . <br><br>  Why did we decide to start our reviews with this solution? <br><br>  The fact is that this is a representative of a new wave of online stores for Joomla.  It takes into account most of the errors of older components, both in terms of code, and in terms of product readiness. <br><br>  Interesting features: <br><br><ul><li>  Initial Setup Wizard. </li><li>  Bonus program for buyers. </li><li>  AJAX filters. </li><li>  XML constructor unloading. </li><li>  Import from XML and CSV. </li><li>  Integration with POS terminals. </li><li>  And many other features that are inherent in modern online stores. </li><li>  All features are available for free. </li></ul><br><h3>  Selection for the developer of sites on Joomla </h3><br>  Updated component for the organization <a href="https://techjoomla.com/free-downloads/rest-api-for-joomla">Rest API on the basis of the Joomla site</a> .
