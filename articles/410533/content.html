And this event has come - <a href="https://ark.intel.com/compare/136440,136441,136436,136438,136439,136437,136435,136434,136433,136431,136432,136430,136429">as many as 14 models have been</a> announced.  Why is the list on the ARK only 13?  There is still no 18-core top model <a href="https://www.intel.ru/content/www/ru/ru/products/processors/xeon/d-processors/d-2191.html">Xeon D 2191</a> .  All other processors have from 4 to 16 hypertreading cores.  The base frequency is 1.6-2.3 GHz, the maximum frequency is 3 GHz.  The amount of cache memory - from 8 to 25 MB. <br><br>  The integrated controller provides up to 32 PCIe lanes, additionally up to 20 Flexible High Speed ​​I / O lanes are offered, which can be configured as PCIe or used to connect additional specialized peripherals.  All processors are made in FCBGA2518 socket and are intended for single socket use. <br><br>  The processors are divided into 3 groups: for network use and storage needs, for cloud services, and a specialized family, sharpened by <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/320380/">Intel QuickAssist</a> encryption and compression hardware acceleration technology <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/320380/">(QAT)</a> .  Under the cut - the separation table by class with the basic characteristics of the models. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/z4/zr/sx/z4zrsxho6mkrfqhisenk24iyldc.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6i/hj/qs/6ihjqsk5fniu6axaqp_b0_lnopo.png"><br><br>  The tables are taken from a <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/12409/intel-launches-xeon-d-2100-series-socs-edge">detailed review of the new Intel Xeon D 2100 family</a> on the <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/">Anandtech</a> website.  Noteworthy are the outstanding characteristics of the older model Xeon D 2191 - there is reason to assume that it was created for special specialized needs. </div>
