<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A few days ago, major media outlets, including Business Insider, TechRadar, WhatHiFi, reported the imminent appearance of the world's first smartphone, equipped with a screen speaker.  According to publications, this device will be the LG G8 ThinQ, which will be demonstrated already on February 25 at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona.  Under the cat more about the new device and technology Crystal Sound OLED, through which it became possible innovation. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jz/le/63/jzle63ks9qrkryd3-6pglqf2yp8.jpeg"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Expected flagship </h3><br>  LG G8 ThinQ - is one of the newsmakers gadgets in the last month.  So, recently blogger Evan Blass managed to publish on Twitter fresh flagship renderers, the media published information that the device will receive a 6.1-inch OLED display with a resolution of 1440 × 3120, and also that the smartphone will be equipped with 6 GB of RAM, a battery 3400 mAh, 128 GB of ROM (flash memory), and, with a high probability, will be built on a Snapdragon 855 chipset. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cd/1c/ob/cd1cobhiujb1pwpe3xd46efsaiq.jpeg"></div><br>  <i>Renders by Evan Blass</i> <br><br>  After all these encouraging news, it was reported that the “cherry on all of this cake” would be that the mentioned 6.1-inch screen would emit sound using Crystal Sound OLED technology. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l4/gh/ul/l4ghulbnsgao8d9hs8uaxa_lngu.jpeg"></div><br>  <i>New phone versus G7</i> <br><br>  In short, the OLED display is converted into a vibrating membrane that radiates sound.  For the first time, the technology was told in 2017, followed by several LG and Sony TVs (we read between the lines from LG Display) and OLED lighting panels from LG as well. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pn/uw/o2/pnuwo2cgycw1m3so4hbztlmkium.jpeg"></div><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kn/d_/zy/knd_zy71kna2nbv4jyq7fpezhjk.jpeg"></div><br>  <i>Crystal Sound OLED TV and Lamp</i> <br><br><h3>  How Crystal Sound OLED Works </h3><br>  In fact, there is nothing super-innovative in Crystal Sound OLED technology.  The principle on which it is based has been known since the late 19th century.  LG skillfully uses the almost forgotten piezoelectric loudspeakers as a driver, causing the screen to vibrate. <br><br>  The piezo speaker uses the <b>inverse piezoelectric effect</b> discovered by Pierre and Jacques Curie in 1880.  The effect occurs when, under the action of an electric field between a metal plate and metallized spraying of piezoelectric ceramics, mechanical deformations occur - vibration, due to which the sound waves are emitted. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/d4/k0/8w/d4k08wvia--yib7ady7cioot1-a.jpeg"></div><br><br>  The principle has received limited application in electronics and, in particular, in electroacoustics.  In addition to the many "tweeters" for electronic watches and alarms, they began to make high-frequency radiators for acoustic systems piezoelectric.  In the 90s, such companies as Motorola, Pioneer, Gemini, Celestion were famous for using such tweeters. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tb/sx/nj/tbsxnjn3jaus8gqyre4imq6hnn0.jpeg"></div><br>  <i>Left - plezoelectric tweeter</i> <br><br>  In cases with speakers, film-type piezo emitters were used: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/au/5j/wz/au5jwz6cy0xtdtkyj_nzkyxdzuw.png"></div><br>  1 - curved domed piezofilm, 2 - damping gasket 3 - special mesh <br><br>  LG returns to the use of ceramics, so for Crystal Sound OLED a “console ceramic piezoelectric driver is used, which is tightly fixed to the screen and transmits vibrations to it (at the same time increasing the area of ​​the radiating surface).  However, due to the high frequency of vibration, no noticeable visual distortion occurs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/m1/9u/yi/m19uyizl5j5qxdzaa4vjuyjjtxi.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/up/f2/zl/upf2zliqzm5r6zxr4ksrxlslm-a.png"><br><br>  Interestingly, the Crystal Sound OLED technology implemented on TVs made it possible to get stereo sound by fixing two piezo emitters on the back of the display.  Obviously, a similar principle will be used in the phone. <br><br><h3>  Likely problems Crystal Sound OLED </h3><br>  The main problem of Crystal Sound OLED, as with the overwhelming majority of alternative emitters, is the physical impossibility of reproducing low frequencies with sufficient amplitude.  This occurs due to the small area of ​​the radiating surface.  It is not surprising that in the experiments conducted in the 90s, such drivers were used exclusively as tweeters. <br><br>  Obviously, the need for low frequencies will force the company to supply devices where the sounding screen miracle is also installed with classic dynamic drivers, which casts doubt on the appropriateness of using this technology.  On the other hand, perhaps LG somehow managed to overcome frequency limits or used technology to reduce power consumption (piezoelectric loudspeakers have high efficiency), which is more likely. <br><br><h3>  Total </h3><br>  Despite the obviousness of the advantages of the new principle and the fact that most likely gadgets with “sounding” screens will additionally equip with traditional speakers, the innovation seems interesting to me.  I would appreciate your opinions in the comments and assessment of the prospects of this “well forgotten old” technology. <br><br>  <i>Traditional jeans</i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="https://www.pult.ru/">We sell</a> electronics, in <a href="https://www.pult.ru/">our catalog there</a> are widely represented acoustic systems, amplifiers, headphones, DACs, players and other audio gadgets.</i> </div>
