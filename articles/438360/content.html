<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vz/hv/ei/vzhveif55dqayfew-g8fve06ufm.jpeg"></div><br>  If you have an interest in all sorts of crazy things, like the Meizu Zero smartphone, which has no port or button, then you can pre-order it on <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/meizu-zero-world-s-first-holeless-phone">Indiegogo</a> for $ 1299.  Supplies are limited, as the company now sells only 100 units of devices. <br><br>  Meizu Zero at first glance looks like any modern phone, but if you turn it in your hands, you will notice that it has absolutely no ports or buttons. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The volume button has been replaced with a touch panel.  A fingerprint sensor is built into the display.  Wireless charging is the only way to charge a device.  And if you are thinking about inserting your SIM card into your phone, then, alas, there is no SIM card slot either (your operator must support eSIM cards). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1n/nb/5s/1nnb5ssxnai98ygjfqnzkbq_dbe.jpeg"></div><br>  There is also no speaker grill.  Meizu uses the screen as a speaker, sending vibrations through the display. <br><br>  It is unclear whether this is just a giant joke or a real product, but this is undoubtedly an interesting experiment.  For $ 1299, you get a phone with a 5.99-inch AMOLED display and a Snapdragon 845 processor. The company expects to begin shipping devices in April of this year. </div>
