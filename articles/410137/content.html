Anyone can see the place of arrival, just going to the window, but only a few can afford to <a href="https://goo.gl/KJo3pp">go there</a> .  The richest people in the world part with the sums of $ 20, $ 30, $ 40 million for the sake of several days in space.  So far, only 7 people have been in orbit as tourists, each of them flying with Russian crews through intermediary company <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Adventures">Space Adventures</a> .  Read more about these pioneers below. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Dennis Anthony Tito </h3><br>  <i>Flight price: $ 20 million</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Flight dates: April 28 - May 6, 2001</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_0/eg/lf/_0eglfe-szzmtmacowhsbcs5tb8.jpeg"></div><br><br>  On April 28, 2001, the first space tourist Dennis Tito went into space. <br><br>  Dennis Anthony Tito was not young.  He was born on August 8, 1940 in New York to a family of poor Italian immigrants.  He founded his own company, Wilshire Associates, became rich, was engaged in ecology, his life was like a well-coordinated mechanism, and he wanted something more - having learned about the opportunity to visit the Mir orbital station as a tourist, he applied to Roscosmos. <br><br>  Preparation for the flight lasted almost 8 months.  Tito was in space for 7 days, 22 hours and 4 minutes.  Despite all-round preparation, he still experienced two unpleasant moments: small heart problems during launch, and in orbit, without calculating his own trajectory in weightlessness, spread the skin on his head, hitting the hatch.  Despite these little things, Tito was delighted with the flight. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2l/5v/xr/2l5vxr7yftgrpjjye6zlo2fazja.png"></div><br><br>  “This is the greatest adventure of my life,” he said when he returned.  - I visited heaven and soared like an angel, looking down to Earth.  He knew that it would be a risky adventure, and was preparing for trials.  However, all six days I experienced euphoria. " <br><br><h3>  Mark Richard Shuttleworth </h3><br>  <i>Flight price: $ 20 million</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Dates of flight: April 25 - May 5, 2002</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1r/wq/um/1rwqumf-sopoxikolgek8smxwjq.jpeg"><br><br>  Mark Shuttleworth was born on September 18, 1973 in the city of Welkom (South Africa).  His father was a surgeon, and his mother was a kindergarten teacher.  Traction to innovative technologies allowed the guy to finish his studies at the University of Cape Town, receiving a bachelor's degree in finance and innovative technologies.  In 1995, Shuttleworth founded the company Thawte, and 10 years later - the Ubuntu Foundation.  Since 2005, owns a controlling stake in the company Impi Linux. <br><br>  Inspired by the flight of Dennis Tito, the first space tourist, Mark decides to do the same.  The dream of a 28-year-old South African businessman came true after filing an application to Space Adventures. <br><br>  Preparation lasted for almost a year.  Mark had to spend seven months in Star City.  The launch into orbit was carried out on the Soyuz TM-34 spacecraft.  Shuttleworth stayed in space for 9 days, 21 hours and 25 minutes.  At the ISS station, he participated in experiments on the study of the genome and AIDS.  On May 5, 2002, Mark returned to Earth, after which he became a national hero in South Africa. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zg/vn/jh/zgvnjhfx-ndlrnw3biqmmxpvzz8.png"></div><br><br>  "A space flight?  Yes, he is very much changing attitudes towards life.  It is impossible to see the Earth from space and not remain deeply impressed by the beauty of the moment ... ”- so Shuttleworth answered the question of what changed his flight into space. <br><br><h3>  Gregory Hammond Olsen </h3><br>  <i>Flight price: $ 20 million</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Flight dates: October 1 - October 11, 2005</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/io/zo/o0/iozoo0ni_i79aaj07uolfswpphw.jpeg"><br>  <i>Gregory Olsen (left)</i> <br><br>  Gregory Olsen was born April 20, 1945 in Brooklyn, New York (USA).  In 1962, Gregory graduated from Ridgefield Park High School.  From that moment on, he simply could not stop - a craving for knowledge for Gregory was compared with a drug.  He received several undergraduate degrees, a doctorate and a degree from the University of Port Elizabeth (South Africa).  From 1972 to 1983, he grew crystals, working for RCA, and in 1984 he founded his own company EPITAXX Inc, which specialized in the production of fiber sensors and emitters.  Thanks to this, Olsen became a millionaire. <br><br>  Gregory had long planned a space flight, so for two years, with a certain frequency, he trained with Russian astronauts in Star City.  Some health problems were the reasons for the unplanned stitching of his flight into space.  The flight finally took place on October 1, 2005. <br><br>  While on the ISS, Olsen not only entertained and enjoyed the view of the stars and planets: he conducted a number of his own experiments on remote sensing and astronomy, and also studied the mutations of microorganisms in zero gravity.  The scientist returned to Earth on October 11, 2005, having stayed in space for 9 days, 21 hours and 15 minutes. <br><br>  “I like to be here, to swim in zero gravity,” Olsen wrote to the Associated Press e-mail, staying on the ISS.  By the way, the scientist does not like to call himself the third space tourist, preferring another name - “the first private researcher”. <br><br><h3>  Anoushe Ansari </h3><br>  <i>Flight price: $ 20 million</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Flight dates: September 18 - September 29, 2006</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tc/0s/wb/tc0swbxf0wftsuefywrtr7biuqg.jpeg"></div><br>  Anoushe Ansari became the first ever space tourist among women. <br><br>  Anush was born on September 12, 1966 in Mashhad, Iran.

In 1993, Anoushe and her brother founded Telecom Technologies, Inc., which brings them multimillion-dollar profits. <br><br>  Anusha Ansari was a backup for the Japanese millionaire Daisuke Enomoto, who was to become the fourth space tourist, but on August 21, 2006, his candidacy was withdrawn due to health problems.  In space, Anusha stayed for almost 12 days and studied the effects of radiation and weightlessness on crew members and microorganisms.  The cosmic tourist returned to Earth on September 29, 2006. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uc/eu/wm/uceuwmrgice8swyqjhi0cbeh-bm.jpeg"></div><br><br><h3>  Charles Simoni </h3><br>  <i>Flight price: $ 25 million + $ 35 million</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Flight dates: April 7 - April 21, 2007 and March 26 - April 7, 2009</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ne/ix/lm/neixlmt7isjvcqjikj5dhycdroq.jpeg"><br><br>  Charles Simoni made two whole flights into space - his wife forbade him to fly for the third time, and this prohibition is contained in his marriage contract. <br><br>  Charles was born on September 10, 1948 in the city of Budapest (Hungary).  In 1966 he moved from Hungary to Denmark, and in 1968 went to study in the United States, where he received citizenship and remained to live.  From 1981, he worked at Microsoft, but in 2002, he left it and founded Intentional Software Corporation. <br><br>  In 2006, Simoni decided to go into space and signed an agreement with Space Adventures, Ltd.  After passing all the necessary medical examinations, Charles began his studies at Star City in September 2006, and on April 7, 2007 he flew away.  The businessman was in space for 15 days and returned to Earth on April 21, 2007.  The second flight of Simoni took place on March 26, 2009 and lasted 14 days. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nz/zx/m_/nzzxm_cg-r6y5yygt9mpc4xm8y0.jpeg"></div><br><br>  “I would have spent a month on the ISS without any questions, I would not be able to spend half a year at the station - for such a long time good preparation is required.  I completed my space program completely: I took part in experiments, helped the main crew, thanks to this they had free time.  It’s a pity that there is no sauna on the ISS, as it was at Mir station, ”commented Charles Simonyi on his first flight. <br><br><h3>  Richard Allen Garriott </h3><br>  <i>Flight price: $ 30 million.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Flight dates: October 12 - October 23, 2008</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tm/ie/24/tmie24qmckmyibt0v8navgg9ujs.jpeg"><br><br>  Richard was born on July 4, 1961 in Cambridge (United Kingdom).
