<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Well, tell me, men, what should we give for February 23?  Ordinary attributes are no longer just turned into memes, but even somehow offended.  Unforgettable sex - once a year, are you serious?  Zaruba in bowling or paintball with friends?  Let's leave this option to office HR.  We are not capricious and not ironic, nobody just asked us.  I had to conduct a kind of research to determine what men really want.  The results surprised us a little. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/gearbest/blog/297683/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/39b/21a/13b/39b21a13b86fb545413a1d4e85003d20.png"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  We waited for greasy jokes, but did not find them. </h2><br>  When it comes time to gender holidays (February 23 and March 8), online shopping is torn down: on the one hand, you need to talk about some promotions, and on the other hand, submit it in a pleasant and interesting way.  This time we thought and thought, and decided to go to Reddit, to peek out, which of the gifts especially like English-speaking users.  Of course, we were looking for something funny, in the shower we were sure that we would see completely the vulgar and analyze all this information. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9dc/04c/18b/9dc04c18b444f86ab8f39cc1535b5b96.png"><br><br>  And got ... a pleasant disappointment. <br><br>  In several huge threads, guys and men told touching, long and short, sincere stories about gifts received and what they would like to receive as a gift (this is a particularly impressive <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/7bcfkp/men_of_reddit_what_is_a_christmas_gift_you_would/">thread</a> ).  We listened to their opinion, chose the most unusual and most common options, and at the same time, proceeding from them, we made our selection with <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/">Gearbest</a> , without drones for a couple of thousand bucks and smartphones for a thousand of them.  Men, tell me, is it true that you have Reddit users, and girls - take note, and well, those razors and bowling certificates! <br><br><h3>  What do men want? </h3><br><ul><li>  Something intangible and romantic.  For example, letters, comfort in the house, a pleasant dinner, a comfortable day without escaping guests, calls and shops.  And yes, be sure to read in a card, how cool it is. <br></li><li>  Loneliness.  A very common wish for family men is to be home alone to play, eat, or just be alone with themselves and gather their thoughts.  Dear girls, if you are on Hiktaimes, understand - this does not mean that you are not loved, it is just a natural desire to retire for a while. <br></li><li>  The things connected with the packaging: for example, something interesting in a hundred packaging layers, a quest to unpack, or vice versa, a lot of nice little things in one box.  Just do not repeat this <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/74Qfd">experiment</a> - it is too cruel!  (Actually, repeat). <br></li><li>  Traditions - for example, instead of expensive gifts and trips to a restaurant, save money for a joint trip to interesting or exotic places.  Another tradition - to give a piggy bank on the harmfulness and excess, for example, on fast food. <br></li><li>  Games, toys, constructors, radio-controlled models are the top abroad, this is the top in China, this is the top in Russia.  Remember, as in the Quartet I in the final “What men are talking about” - there are no adults, there are aged children. <br></li></ul><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qt1BqpnPopg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><ul><li>  Toys based on movies and comics. <br></li><li>  Unusual alarm clocks are a great way to remind yourself of a gift every morning. <br></li><li>  Forever missing tools and multitools.  That is why girls fifteen pots and nineteen palettes of eye shadow are the rules, and we, the peasants, do not need a hundred screwdrivers, heads and multitools?  It is necessary, even as needed! <br></li><li>  Or, “ <i>The other day I bought a $ 4 usb cable that glows in the dark, because I always complain about the USB cable that I plugged into my computer and can't be seen.</i>  <i>I was delighted.</i>  " <br></li><li>  Coffee and coffee itself: the Turks, coffee machines, coffee grinders.  But this is for fans and connoisseurs.  Tea is also a concern.  Do not forget to explore the tastes. <br></li><li>  Arduino and Raspberry are our people! <br></li><li>  Flashlights <br></li><li>  Readers and e-books already uploaded to them. <br></li><li>  Musical instruments. <br></li><li>  Nontrivial clothes - funny and cool T-shirts, sweatshirts, warm sweaters and scarves. <br></li><li>  Nostalgic toys - those that were in childhood or those that remind you of important things (for example, someone is looking for old Lego sets). <br></li></ul><br><h3>  The most unusual gifts and wishes </h3><br><ul><li>  12 sheets half inch plywood. <br></li><li>  Assemble two designers for 10 dollars, put them on the shelf as a symbol of love (below we found a way to repeat it). <br></li><li>  Fluffy blanket. <br></li><li>  Cosmetics, which really solve the problem, but will not get into the collection of unnecessary bubbles and jars.  For example, a cool hand cream that can cope with dry skin after repairs and building mixes. <br></li></ul><br>  As you can see, no one asked for an iPhone X or even a PlayStation.  So doing cute surprises is much easier than it seems.  You do not need to endlessly go shopping and clutch at the head.  Enough to put the soul, hands and a little imagination and love.  And it does not matter if she gives him or him a son, dad, brother, friend or boss ... <br><br><h2>  Material things for intangible emotions </h2><br>  In addition to the above, a man needs two things for complete happiness: a radio-controlled machine and a radio-controlled helicopter.  Better, of course, if all this together - as in the <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/rc-cars/pp_1358967.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">Rastar BMW Aircraft Model set</a> for $ 66.99.  The kit contains a BMW I8 car model and a small light helicopter (just for an apartment).  Maximum speed - 8.2 km / h, runs on batteries and battery.  In general, the set is interesting and unusual. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c53/45e/d28/c5345ed28822d89302bd7e8b55db568f.png"></div><br>  This is our personal choice, but to dwell on one idea of ​​a gift is somehow not very fair, so we chose a few more different options, based on several principles: <br><br><ul><li>  a gift for February 23 in general should not be expensive <br></li><li>  the holiday was transformed, and it is now customary to congratulate all men from 0 to 120 on it <br></li><li>  the gift should be fan and non-standard (not a cup, not socks, not a thermos, not a razor) <br></li><li>  the gift should be such that both girls and men could give it. <br></li></ul><br><h3>  This wonderful mobile world </h3><br>  Among the new mobile devices worth paying attention to the headset bracelet for smartphones running iOS and Android - <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/smart-watches/pp_1306742.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">HUAWEI B3 Smartband</a> for $ 98.50.  It may seem to you that this is a normal fitness bracelet, but no: it tracks activity, sends notifications about calls and messages (including mail and messengers) and can be a Bluetooth headset for talking and listening to music.  The device is waterproof and has IP57 protection. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/243/539/f9b/243539f9b57fb126d62f26e97bd527dd.png"></div><br>  <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/usb-flash-drives/pp_1232195.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">A</a> 64 GB <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/usb-flash-drives/pp_1232195.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">metal</a> Type-C <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/usb-flash-drives/pp_1232195.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">flash drive</a> for $ 47.51 with a convenient ring will expand the smartphone's memory to please anyone - thanks to its convenient design, the storage device can be hooked to the keys and any other hinges (on the bag, on the clothes).

Spring and summer are just around the corner, hiking, vacations, and friendly camping trips will begin, and then you can’t do without a waterproof, durable smartphone.  And the characteristics for ten thousand rubles with kopecks are quite good: 2 GB of RAM, 16 GB of internal memory, NFC, Android 7.0 operating system and 4,700 mAh battery.  The display is 5 inches, the front camera is 8 megapixels, and the main one is 13 megapixels. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_1583876.html%3Flkid%3D10721409"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/254/3dd/378/2543dd37891fb30772fce48ded72db78.png"></a> </div><br>  Well, if you still want to give an interesting, but not a standard smartphone, then look at the <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_1549830.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">OUKITEL K10 4G Phablet</a> .

It is quite strong and reliable, weighs 524 grams, you can work with it both in your hands and on the stand.  The battery will not fail - 5200 mAh provide long battery life.  TTX is quite decent for its price: OS Android 7.1, RAM 2 GB, built-in 32 GB, eight-core processor.

The magnification is 1000 times, the resolution is 640 * 280.  Important note - the microscope is compatible only with the Windows OS family (including 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 10).  In principle, not the most powerful device, but as an educational toy for $ 32.78 - more than a decent option. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/microscopes-endoscope/pp_576314.html%3Flkid%3D10721409"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8f6/f0f/acc/8f6f0facc7ed1d0bee9b59265dd11054.png"></a> </div><br>  How about collecting your little <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/block-toys/pp_699636.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">All Terrain Armored Transport</a> , aka AT-AT from Star Wars?  The armored walker will please the fan of the space epic - it can be assembled from 30 parts that need to be “broken down” from metal plates.  It does not assemble very quickly, but quite simply - all the joints, seams, and engraving are done accurately and accurately.  Such a thing can be presented to anyone - from a minor family member to your boss, the finished toy will look cool on the businessman’s desk, among school textbooks, on a sysadmin’s littered desk, and between several programmer’s monitors.  Only $ 6.85.  For those who like to not so much stand, how much light - there is a version of the <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/3d-lamps/pp_976487.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">LED lamp in the form of the same walking machine</a> . <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/block-toys/pp_699636.html%3Flkid%3D10721409"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/65b/15a/6c0/65b15a6c0d83d6e5a64154bc3cf5df0a.png"></a> </div><br>  Choosing a radio-controlled car, it is difficult to stop at one thing.

Despite the non-truck appearance, the truck is very lively and even knows how to carry light loads.  It is controlled at a distance of 30-80 m, it can drive about half an hour on a single charge, the charge time is an hour, the speed is quite “cargo” - 10 km / h.  The car can move both on asphalt and off-road (without fanaticism!).  In general, $ 32.99 for such a toy is not a pity. <br><br> <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/rc-cars/pp_1214989.html%3Flkid%3D10721409"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d3d/13b/bd0/d3d13bbd025a4a3d1e3f5ebdbca1868d.png"></a> <br>  Inexpensive <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/rc-helicopters/pp_226503.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">radio-controlled helicopter</a> for $ 139.47 - is controlled at a distance of 120 meters, flies for 5 minutes, can rotate 360 ​​degrees, fly forward / back, up / down, left / right, accelerate.

At the same time the car is resistant to overturning and breakage. <br><div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/rc-cars/pp_1309080.html%3Flkid%3D10721409"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d56/c2a/ecf/d56c2aecfecd8bd8f8b1bea021501642.png"></a> </div><br><h3>  Any usefulness and utility </h3><br>  Not quite geeky, but a universal gift for almost any age is a men's bag.  Despite the enormous popularity of backpacks, they are still not suitable for everyone - someone just does not like to wear everything behind their backs, someone is forced or prefers to walk in a suit.  It is clear that the backpack here is an undignified and even inappropriate variant.  We have selected three types of bags that can fit almost all styles of clothing. <br><br><ul><li>  A classic bag that can be used as a cover for a laptop or as a business briefcase - for example, <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/crossbody-bags/pp_1461614.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">this one for $ 36.99</a> . <br></li><li>  Bag-tablet is a good option for those who have to move a lot, but do not carry a laptop with them - for example, <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/crossbody-bags/pp_1414056.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">this one is for $ 23.03</a> .  Many branches are a good option for business people who need to separately store documents, checks, records, and so on. <br></li><li>  "Anti-theft" bag - the closest, but stylish relative of the backpack, which can be worn on the chest, to always keep track of the contents.  This is not a total classic, but <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/crossbody-bags/pp_1053042.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">such a leather version for $ 36.51 is</a> suitable for those who grew out of a backpack, but will not refuse to move on a bicycle and keep the most important thing and you need to be with you. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ba0/30d/219/ba030d21975e73ddf28561f9b449cf2b.png"><br>  Well, if the backpacks fly only on the road, and a new durable version that looks decent, that is, a simple, lightweight, durable <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/backpacks/pp_687135.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">backpack for urban walks</a> and work, is always relevant.

But polarized glasses are a completely different matter.  Special lenses scatter light in a special way and allow you to feel comfortable behind the wheel on any road: wet, icy, snowy, etc.  It is especially pleasant to ride them at sunset or at dawn - the sun practically does not interfere, but how much vanity, romance and purely male imagery, get the pedal down and go towards the sun (be careful driving!).  Xiaomi has <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/stylish-sunglasses/pp_650301.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">stylish aviators</a> (which, by the way, are suitable for almost all types and shapes of the face). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/stylish-sunglasses/pp_650301.html%3Flkid%3D10721409"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c52/cea/8fe/c52cea8fe3e94bb72d1673e35ba24415.png"></a> </div><br>  If cars are not what your friend / husband / boyfriend / brother / father likes, then take care of the eyes of this computer genius.  <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/other-eyewear/pp_666152.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">Xiaomi has glasses</a> that minimize <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/other-eyewear/pp_666152.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">eye</a> damage from the light of multiple monitors and displays. <br><br>  Of the options with Reddit listed in the first part, we liked the one where the couple collected two figures and put them on the shelf.  It seems to us that this can be done not only on February 23 or March 8, but on any day, for example, sitting in a cafe or at a home-cooked dinner.  Whatever we are here, all the harsh men are, and such warm moments like almost everyone.  We were looking for a suitable option and found it: <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/block-toys/pp_630066.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">courageous Mickey</a> and <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/block-toys/pp_628628.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">charming Minnie</a> .  Only less than $ 4 each, and how many impressions and values.  Try it. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/block-toys/pp_628628.html%3Flkid%3D10721409"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e3a/ce2/627/e3ace2627f65a61df48206492b1b2d4b.png"></a> </div><br><h3>  The most serious supermen </h3><br>  And there is one more thing - these are gifts for little men who still go to school, but feel their holiday.  This feeling should be encouraged, so we have three more things that our customers like and are suitable for boys: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/men-s-watches/pp_655844.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">Stylish mechanical watches for $ 17.99</a> are not Tissot, of course, but they will be the pride of a 5-7-grader who, in spite of cellular, tablets and other electronics, dreams of real watches.  By the way, the watch really gives a sense of style and masculinity. <br></li><li>  <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/smart-watches/pp_1565940.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">Sports watch for $ 27.99</a> - a smart watch with a touchscreen, long battery life, pedometer, clock, the ability to fumble for success through the application, etc.  Such a gadget can teach to a healthy lifestyle and self-control. <br></li><li>  Well, as without the queen of the holiday, the <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/electric-shavers/pp_1175985.html%3Flkid%3D10721409">Xiaomi razor</a> ?  Joking  Two options when the razor is appropriate: 1) it is really needed and you need it;  2) the guy starts to shave and he needs a good device. <br></li></ul><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/85e/f50/9eb/85ef509eb1132ca80513c7997f15b2fe.png"></div><br>  In fact, gifts are not a commitment or a tribute.  This is the impulse of the soul, expressed in material form.  You can live with a person for ten years and not find out that the most desirable gift for him will be the old game “Electronics”, in which the wolf catches eggs in the basket (no, on the emulator, the sensations are not the same!) Or a warm checkered rug for work, because panoramic window and it is still cold.  And all because even living in the same apartment, we talk so little with each other and so rarely look in our eyes.  Let's do it more often. </div>
