<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  One of the components of the cheap “smart home” Sonoff is the BN-SZ01 LED-panel, which can be used with the shades from ordinary lamps. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eab/622/ae8/eab622ae84592376159a1f03b67ff613.jpg"></div><br>  I measured the light parameters and electrical parameters of this panel. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the center of the panel is the electronics unit, which includes a LED driver and a WIFI control module. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e23/ce3/010/e23ce30101724d5da32378ea70b43d88.jpg"></div><br>  Behind the metal panel with three magnets that can be used for mounting. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0d7/2c7/109/0d72c71099da5b71b0bbef149efc8f8e.jpg"></div><br>  Unlike other Sonoff devices, there is no button, and to enter the synchronization mode, you must first turn on the panel in the network, and then, five times at intervals of about two seconds, disconnect it from the network and turn it on again. <br><br>  In the eWelink application, you can enable and disable the panel, as well as see its current status.  There is a panel behavior setting at power on (on, off, last state).  As with other Sonoff devices, you can configure the power-on schedule and timers. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4d2/c13/7f3/4d2c137f312e79fcfe80b68f95a46da6.jpg"></div><br>  On the Sonoff website, the power of the panel is 18 W, the color temperature is 6500K (for some reason, only on the <a href="https://www.itead.cc/smart-home/bn-sz01.html">English-language page</a> ), the operating voltage is 180-264V (there is an error on the Russian page, it says 180-364V).  The luminous flux is clearly not specified, only 100 lm / W is written (18x100 = 1800 lm is obtained).  On the panel itself is written 160-265V 20W. <br><br>  The luminous flux was measured using a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ammo1.ru/videos/1302633673165472/%3Fpnref%3Dstory">two-meter integrating sphere and a Instrument Systems spectrometer</a> , the lighting angle and consumption characteristics of the Viso Light Spion instrument, the power consumption of the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/lamptest/blog/274246/">Robiton PM-2</a> instrument, the color rendering index, color temperature and pulsation with the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/lamptest/blog/282344/">Uprtek MK350D instrument</a> .  The minimum operating voltage, at which the luminous flux decreased by no more than 10% of the nominal, was measured using a <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/lamptest/blog/286276/">Lamptest-1</a> device, Stable Stab Instab <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/lamptest/blog/285480/">500</a> , LATP Suntek TDGC2-0.5 and an <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/lamptest/blog/286134/">Aneng AN8001 multimeter</a> .  Before measurements to stabilize the parameters, the LED panel warmed up for half an hour. <br><br>  The measured power of the panel is 17 W, the luminous flux is 1540 lm, the color temperature is 6261K, the color rendition index (CRI, Ra) is 85.8.  The pulsation of light is practically absent.  The minimum voltage at which the LED panel can work is 126 volts. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f85/186/84c/f8518684c76f58453a387de66d48bcca.jpg"></div><br>  Angle of illumination. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/573/8fc/c7a/5738fcc7a052c2bf3101e10c8adf3f35.png"></div><br>  Oscillogram of current consumption.  Power factor (power factor) - 0.51. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/673/306/577/6733065770373c9d7d3f8114c1ed8e92.png"></div><br>  The brightness of the LED-panel corresponds to an incandescent lamp 150 watts.  It has a rather high color rendering index, but the panel light is too cold for use in residential areas.  Scientists recommend the use of warm light 2700-3000K in bedrooms, nurseries and living rooms, contributing to relaxation.  In kitchens, work areas and office spaces, neutral white light 4000K is considered optimal, contributing to concentration.  Cold light, like this panel, is more suitable for outbuildings and utility rooms.  It is a pity that Sonoff does not have the same panels with warm and neutral light. <br><br>  The manufacturer (by the way, Itead does not produce these panels itself, but ewelink-eco) indicates that the panel does not support dimming, however, in some alternative firmware this function exists and the brightness in alternative applications is adjustable. <br><br>  In the official online store Itead, the LED panel with WIFI BN-SZ01 costs $ 8.5. <br><br>  © 2018, Alexey Nadyozhin </div>
