Previous parts of the article are published <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/435416/">here</a> and <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/435738/">here</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Organization of safe work </h1><br>  When working with electronic equipment and other electrical devices should strictly observe the rules of electrical safety! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/de3/127/e82/de3127e82b7bffff7dbe7d6f0aecb8d3.jpg"><br><br>  Briefly, but essentially, the basic rules of electrical safety in amateur radio practice are set forth in the article ‚ÄúCaution!  Electric current ‚Äù- Radio ‚Ññ8, 1983, p.55. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">See scan articles</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cb6/89a/b9f/cb689ab9fc0d896ca4250c592d97e67b.jpg"><br></div></div><br>  I strongly recommend, also, to study the publication <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/olartamonov/" class="user_link">olartamonov</a> <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/428023/">"Fundamentals of electrical safety in the design of electronic devices</a> . <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/428023/">"</a> <br><br><h1>  Workplace organization </h1><br>  The work place of the radio amateur must be equipped with instruments, tools and, as experience shows, a storage cell inaccessible to small children and pets. <br><br>  The final set of instruments and tools is determined by the scope of work of the project and the list of the technical characteristics of the product of the project that need to be confirmed in tests. <br><br>  The minimum required for workplace equipment: <br><br><ul><li>  inexpensive laboratory power supply; </li><li>  inexpensive soldering station; </li><li>  inexpensive multimeter; </li><li>  ruler; </li><li>  set of screwdrivers; </li><li>  set of wrenches (4x5, 5.5x7, 8x10, etc.); </li><li>  pliers; </li><li>  side cutters; </li><li>  stripping tool; </li><li>  mounting tweezers. </li></ul><br>  Even in the work may need: <br><br><ul><li>  hand tools (vise, handsaw, files, etc.); </li><li>  oscilloscope; </li><li>  computer; </li><li>  logic analyzer; </li><li>  programmer, etc. </li></ul><br>  It should be noted that the ‚Äúminimum set‚Äù will already cost the radio amateur in the amount of about 5000 RUR, and the cost of additional equipment has no upper limit. <br><br><h1>  Test organization </h1><br>  Ignorance of the law ‚ÄúOn ensuring the uniformity of measurements‚Äù dated 06.26.2008 No. 102-–§–ó is not an excuse (joke). <br><br>  In amateur projects, most measurements are made with cheap multimeters.  For a <a href="http://www.permcsm.ru/node/359/search/m838">modest amount of</a> twice the cost of <a href="https://www.chipdip.ru/product0/8084976545">such a multimeter</a> , you can calibrate it at a local standardization and metrology center (CMS).  And we can assume that in an amateur project it is enough accuracy of measuring electrical quantities of the order of 3 ... 5%, and save money on instrument calibration. <br><br>  Also, in an amateur project, it is permissible to confirm the characteristics of a product not by conducting expensive tests, but by any indirect methods of confirmation.  In publications about the project on the use of indirect confirmation methods, it is worth writing in plain text.  For example: <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúListening amplifier was conducted in a room of 50 cubic meters.</i>  <i>m on the speaker system Radiotehnika S-90 in satisfactory condition.</i>  <i>The amplifier input was connected to the Creative E-MU 0404 USB sound card line out.</i>  <i>The source of the signal was a <a href="http://lasinfo.ru/Las_new/FSQ/FSQ.html">test disk ‚ÄúAudio FSQ‚Äù in WAV format</a> .</i>  <i>The sound picture observed during listening completely corresponded to the description to a test disk.</i>  <i>Evaluation amplifier sound: acceptable. "</i> <br><br>  But in commercial projects the customer will necessarily require confirmation of the conformity of product characteristics to technical requirements by measuring these characteristics.  Measurement of characteristics will have to be carried out with measuring instruments of the required accuracy class, having a valid certificate of verification. <br><br>  And here such a situation is possible when the cost of testing the product of a project will exceed the cost of developing this product and producing a prototype for testing.  Therefore, in the early stages of a commercial project it is necessary: <br><br><ul><li>  carefully coordinate with the customer technical requirements for the product; </li><li>  to achieve the approval by the customer of the draft program and test method with a list of measuring instruments necessary for the test; </li><li>  It is necessary to include the cost of testing in the project budget, taking into account the purchase and lease of measuring instruments, subcontracting of accredited laboratories, etc. </li></ul><br><br><h1>  Procurement Organization </h1><br>  The quality of the product of a project is largely determined by the quality of the components in its composition, and the volumes of supply of counterfeit components on the market are simply terrifying! <br><br>  When purchasing components for amateur projects you should not be guided only by price.  It is also worth paying attention to the reputation of the supplier, the range of its supplies, ease of delivery and the possibility of returning and exchanging low-quality goods.  It is usually easier to order everything from one supplier and pay him for the door-to-door delivery than to collect the same order, saving a few percent, from several suppliers. <br><br>  The body of the product in an amateur project is easier to pick up already finished in the catalog.  According to the dimensional assembly drawings of the selected enclosure, it is necessary to determine the method of mounting the printed circuit boards and their connecting dimensions even before the start of the trace of these printed circuit boards. <br><br><h1>  The organization of the manufacture of the model / prototype / prototype </h1><br>  As mentioned earlier, the winning strategy in an amateur project is to model each solution.  In the simplest case, the layout is assembled on a standard breadboard with a pitch of 2.54 mm, for example, as shown: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b27/424/bf0/b27424bf01a7536fb209e65f7ac075fa.jpg"><br><br>  I would like to focus on the purchase module sealed to the board.  This, like the assembly of conductors into bundles, is made to increase the rigidity of the layout design, since  he must remain operable after transportation, strikes, falls from the table, etc. <br><br>  It is not always possible to assemble a model on a standard board.  In this case, it is necessary to develop and produce its own PCB.  A popular method of producing printed circuit boards at home is ‚Äúlaser-iron technology‚Äù (LUT).  LUT requires plumbing work and work with chemical reagents.  Details about this can be found, for example, in the publication of <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/himura/" class="user_link">Himura</a> <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/417501/">‚ÄúLayfkhaki manufacturing of double-layer boards (LUT)‚Äù</a> . <br><br>  Currently, you can order the production of double-sided boards of 100x100 mm <a href="https://jlcpcb.com/quote">here</a> and <a href="https://www.pcbway.com/orderonline.aspx">here</a> for amounts comparable to the cost of manufacturing printed circuit boards for LUT.  Boards are made in 2 ... 3 days, delivery takes 2 ... 3 weeks.  Boards are made on gerber-files of layers in the RS-274X format and in the drilling file in the EXCELLON format.  These files can be exported from almost all CAD designed for tracing printed circuit boards. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b1b/85b/193/b1b85b193a4b2ab6d2be48f4f7e6a5cc.jpg"><br><br>  Before starting to trace the board, you must make sure that the enclosures of the elements ordered to assemble the board correspond to the footprints of these elements in the CAD libraries.  Board routing should begin with specifying the overall dimensions of the board and the coordinates of the fastening elements, which are determined by the drawings of the ordered case.  Then, on the board, display and control organs are placed, then connectors are placed on the board, then the rest of the components. <br><br>  If the motherboard is being developed as an expansion card for any platform, first it will house mounting holes and connectors for the form factor of this platform, and only then display and control elements will be placed on it, and then everything else. <br><br>  Between the functional units on the printed circuit board, it is desirable to leave gaps.  The conductors that make up the interface, it is desirable to lay on the board together.  After placing the main circuit elements on a double-sided board, it is advisable to start tracing from the power lines of these elements and always remember that there is no excessive cross section on the power lines.  When connecting an element, you should be guided by examples from the datasheet on this element and documentation on the debugging board, if any.  And in general, on issues of tracing printed circuit boards, I highly recommend to contact the free <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/iamsam/" class="user_link">Samsams</a> <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/429560/">"SamsPcbGuide" manual</a> . <br><br><h1>  Organization of installation and commissioning </h1><br>  Installation and adjustment of amateur constructions are carried out on an equipped workplace.  If the workplace is soldered, the room must be well ventilated.  Illumination of the workplace should be sufficient. <br><br>  Before switching on the assembled structure, it is necessary to check the correctness of the installation.  <b>If the structure is connected to the AC network, it is necessary to measure the insulation resistance of the primary power supply circuits before switching on.</b>  <b>When conducting adjustments and adjustments, it is necessary to strictly observe the electrical safety rules!</b>  <b>(see the article "Caution! Electric Current")</b> <br><br>  Adjustment of any design begins with checking the characteristics of the power supply system.  Next, in turn, debug the operation of the functional blocks in the product.  After adjusting the functional blocks, the functioning of the product as a whole is checked. <br><br>  After adjustment, the final tests of conformity of the product characteristics to the technical requirements are carried out, as was written earlier. <br><br><h1>  Project closing </h1><br>  Amateur project, if funding is not involved, you can close at any time.  Publication of the results of an amateur project should contain, as a minimum: <br><br><ul><li>  problem statement; </li><li>  principal electric circuit; </li><li> firmware file; </li><li>  description of the results achieved. </li></ul><br>  A publication is also welcome: <br><br><ul><li>  picture (and better gerber files) of the circuit board; </li><li>  list of items (BOM); </li><li>  firmware source codes; </li><li>  installation and setup instructions, etc. </li></ul><br><br><h3>  Instead of conclusion </h3><br>  This publication ends the article "DIY Project Technique".  The purpose of the article was to help enthusiasts in the organization of their project activities, as well as to highlight the differences in approaches to the implementation of amateur and commercial projects. <br><br>  I really hope that the experience outlined in the publication will help readers in organizing technical creativity.  And I really hope that any assessment of the article will be accompanied by a comment. <br><br>  73!  Before communication! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/436800/">https://habr.com/ru/post/436800/</a></p>
