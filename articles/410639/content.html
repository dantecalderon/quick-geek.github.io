<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day!  In our blog, we often told not only about our gadgets, but also about the changes that were happening to them.  Today we have prepared a material on how the handle from NeoLab has changed: now the multiplayer mode, work with PC and special software for conferences. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qh/2r/68/qh2r68thjctys6ujwej7qfwtbsk.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/neo-smartpen-n2.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dn2%26utm_campaign%3Dn2">Smart pen N2</a> - one of the best in its class for convenience and comfort of use.  Despite the fact that we still have a gadget, it has a convenient shape and dimensions of a regular pen, which greatly simplifies the process of use. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tn/cg/57/tncg57mwad60deaocmwbplgvmk8.jpeg"><br><br>  In terms of its external features, such a pen differs little from ordinary accessories: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/iq/vn/0u/iqvn0ufqrtdupeh-thnpvz3uq_m.jpeg"><br><br>  In terms of connection and use, everything is also quite simple here: in order to connect the handle with the device, you need to hold down a single button until the “blinking signal” <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/h4/b7/bq/h4b7bqqnfecb_wfo_ep8lotl8sq.jpeg"><br><br>  and connect the gadget. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5n/8j/tk/5n8jtk0swqvdyrq1d74vfxok3ne.gif"><br><br>  Until 2018, the pen worked only in a pair with applications for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ae/app/neo-notes/id916072725%3Fmt%3D8">IOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dkr.neolab.neonote">Android</a> , where it was necessary to work with notes.  Here it was possible to save and process records or drawings in real time, choose the thickness and color of lines ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3k/ss/7n/3kss7n0c7vgbbakamotijqfqtmy.png"><br><br>  And also use the handwriting “digitization” mode: for this, it was necessary to download the dictionary in the desired language.  He worked in principle even properly in “difficult” cases, for example, “hear”, where there are quite a few letters merging into a letter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jz/xu/i7/jzxui7g0ki1gm3er77z9d7bmexi.png"><br><br>  All data could be imported or instantly sent to recipients. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uo/4b/mv/uo4bmv7lg9e3uznqzl30xlzthdo.png"><br><br>  <b>"Application for conferences"</b> <br><br>  Relatively recently, a second PaperTube application ( <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ae/app/papertube/id1317169114%3Fmt%3D8">iOS</a> / <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dkr.neolab.papertube%26hl%3Dru">Android</a> ) is available for working with a smart pen.  This is the so-called "conference application. This software allows you to simultaneously record and simultaneously take notes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rh/3o/2t/rh3o2tnb1qxdyvcx6zilr5pkx6m.gif"><br><br>  The most likely use scenario seems to be recording the speaker, lecturer on video with instant comments in the notebook, notepad for further work with the material.  Such a model of use can be equally useful at the institute, at a meeting, and at some business conference, including journalists reporting. <br><br>  <b>Business gadget and computer work</b> <br><br>  From 2018, the N2 pen can be paired with a PC on Windows 10. To synchronize, you need to download a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/ru-ru/store/p/neo-notes/9n67pcq4mtcv">corporate application</a> from Microsoft Store, and then proceed according to the already known scenario - the pen is synchronized with a computer via Bluetooth. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/aj/4d/b3/aj4db3goc6pjkpsqnrgjhxl1cgm.jpeg"><br><br>  Supports and full screen mode. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kf/nh/ec/kfnhecyazwvcwbvpcg9eztymnjo.jpeg"><br><br>  And also supports multi-user "creative" mode: up to 6 smart pens for collaboration can be connected to one document. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ly/9s/7q/ly9s7qmw29l5r0r5asl45ofgkqs.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>How it works</b> <br><br>  N2 works on the “pen + notepad” principle, and the “pen” shape is not just chosen for reasons of “prestige”. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ct/yz/y_/ctyzy_4awjngjpwfzje-q-eunny.jpeg"><br><br>  Under the rod is a scanner that reads written with a special markup. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_h/-o/bj/_h-objjzl4nddasrfqbuqutsu3i.jpeg"><br><br>  The pen works in tandem with branded notebooks, and here, usually, users sometimes experience some disturbance, because the “subscription” model has not really taken root in Russia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ou/mk/uw/oumkuwe94pbndnlyvztxvm3ouis.png"><br><br>  Here it can be noted that, firstly, for any pen, people often buy notebooks or diaries.  For pen N2, the cost of branded notebooks starts from 590 rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/m1/uu/6i/m1uu6iiykzidxgl2edk4wjwllzc.jpeg"><br><br>  You can also add that PDF with NCode markup can be printed for free from the official site.  And finally, a small notebook still comes complete with a pen in one box. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jd/yw/yp/jdywyp3_xaia62egrvlysfcx_6c.jpeg"><br><br>  Pen for sale in two colors: black and silver. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vk/q7/iq/vkq7iqhchbd_nkpkfpu7jjwhs7q.jpeg"><br><br>  The kit also includes an extra terminal and charging cable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jv/xy/ti/jvxytipcmbykfleoy7el6-zet9s.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Eventually</b> <br><br>  The clever N2 handle added a lot of convenience: now, apart from standard operating scenarios, there are several more in branded applications.  This is primarily due to attempts to get the attention of a new audience. <br><br>  If earlier the pen was positioned by the manufacturer as an accessory for creativity, for designers, artists, as mentioned by numerous promotional materials. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rt/6w/o_/rt6wo_o41--4sfvwxfovlualrn4.jpeg"><br><br>  Now, it is obvious that N2 is both a business gadget and a gadget for creative professions, for example, journalists. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">For those who want to buy</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Currently there <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/neo-smartpen-n2.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dn2%26utm_campaign%3Dn2">is</a> a 15% discount <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/neo-smartpen-n2.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dn2%26utm_campaign%3Dn2">coupon</a> - <b>AWCVTPLF</b> . <br></div></div></div>
