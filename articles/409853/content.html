<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Few people on the Internet have heard of the crazy billionaire Ilona Mask.  He dreams of conquering Mars, launches reusable rockets into orbit, is terribly afraid of artificial intelligence - and, meanwhile, is responsible for the release of Tesla electric vehicles.  Their innovator wants to lower the ground into underground high-speed tunnels that would bypass the California traffic jams.  For the implementation of the last project, Musk founded the Boring Company.  And in order to finance the excavations near Los Angeles, Musk began selling <a href="https://www.boringcompany.com/flamethrower">branded jet flamethrowers</a> through the Internet.  Everything is logical.  But is it legal?  Good question! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dm/ic/nn/dmicnnbrbjm_c5j-lpgnk3ijzrm.jpeg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Sales of unusual "souvenirs" began on Sunday, January 28, only in the first 24 hours orders for 7,000 flamethrowers arrived.  In total there were 20,000 of these devices.  Despite the solid price tag of $ 500, almost all of them scattered in just a couple of days, like hot cakes.  Before the flame throwers, Musk sold far less flammable caps with the Boring Company logo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/iz/yq/xj/izyqxjkalbkqlpzwrx_d9uzooxi.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  In December, the <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/940056523304181762">billionaire promised</a> that after 50,000 caps purchased, he would launch flamethrowers for sale.  That is what happened as a result. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jn/px/zu/jnpxzuwdfrcfvjbfwhojr6snwj0.gif" alt="image"></div><br>  In the US, citizens are not forbidden to buy and store many types of weapons, so the last “toy” Mask was not shocked by the habit of shooting the public.  However, MP Miguel Santiago from Los Angeles wants to ban a flamethrower in California.  “With great strength comes great responsibility,” the politician told reporters.  His concern was met by an extremely aggressive reaction and ridicule. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pt/ag/eu/ptageumugy1mwrwwocx1xr-haju.jpeg" alt="image"></div><br>  And what awaits the “boring flamethrower” Mask in Russia?  Or, let's put the question squarely: what awaits the brave buyer in Russia?  To begin with, in fact, this gadget is a very beautiful blowtorch in the form of an airsoft rifle.  It looks like a weapon, but it is not;  its maximum flame emission is less than 3 meters, which is less than the limit imposed by US federal law.  As Musk himself said, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has nothing against the device.  In the US, such devices are often used for burning grass and snow removal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gd/_l/3b/gd_l3b964oixwouddhhwqvkie8e.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>And in Canada they love to burn snow!</i>  <i>Pictured: Winsor, Ontario</i> <br><br>  Blow torches in Russia are unequivocally resolved and are used for their intended purpose and not for their intended purpose.  With flamethrowers, the situation is more complicated, and is regularly discussed in the forums of fans of small arms and lawyers.  The fact is that in the Russian legislation nowhere is there a ban specifically on this type of weapon. <br><br>  In the federal law “On Arms” in the latest edition there is neither an explicit mention of the flamethrower, nor even a uniquely suitable description (especially for the Boring Company flamethrower).  Of course, an attentive reader will point out article 6: “On the territory of the Russian Federation, the following are prohibited: 1) trafficking in civilian and service weapons: &lt;...&gt; weapons and other items, the damaging effect of which is based on the use of radioactive radiation and biological factors;  weapons and other items, the damaging effect of which is based on the use of electromagnetic, light, <b>heat,</b> infrasonic or ultrasonic radiation ", but will be discouraged by reading the last paragraph of Article 1:" The weapons do not include products certified as household and industrial products assignments, sports equipment, structurally similar to weapons (hereinafter referred to as products structurally similar to weapons).  Structurally similar to firearms products should not contain the main parts of firearms. "  According to established practice, in such cases, the assistance of experts is involved. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/by/zb/ba/byzbbalrstox5vwaujjk5iyx_mc.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>The Boring Company Flamethrower Flamethrower</i> <br><br>  At this point, the construction itself becomes important.  Musk did not disclose the details, preferring to joke about the fact that his gadget is no more dangerous than a steak knife.  Judging by the photos and videos, the Boring Company flamethrower has a very small gas cylinder.  Ognesmes is emitted only with the use of compressed gas, but not powder charge.  It turns out that, if desired, it can be classified as a pneumatic weapon.  Muzzle energy is unknown (at least due to the lack of bullets).  In theory: if it does not exceed 3 J, then a license and registration are not required.  Criminal liability for the storage and use of pneumatics is not provided. <br><br>  It is clear that the last paragraph makes sense only if the representatives of the state are trying to appoint a blowtorch as a weapon.  This possibility exists.  Moreover, Musk unequivocally sells his device as a “flamethrower”.  Safe flamethrower for parties. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/y-/j8/ww/y-j8ww5vzlhzthg43vdzd00wmya.gif" alt="image"></div><br>  By the way, Musk is not the first who came up with the fiery idea of ​​selling consumer fire-breathing devices in the form of handguns.  In 2015, the Arizona startup The Ion Productions Team launched a campaign on Indiegogo to finance the production of a portable device XM42 with a range of 9 meters.  First, the project met with an insurmountable obstacle in the form of bans in California and Maryland.  In 2017, the company released a new version of the model - XM42-M.  On Mask's hand-made article in Ion Productions speak with irony: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ionprodteam/photos/a.679350302191202.1073741828.644800338979532/1451619781630913/%3Ftype%3D3%26theater">"This is just a burner with which we start our flamethrower."</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nq/zg/vi/nqzgvi21berswvrspgbym32hqtg.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>XM42-M, a serious flamethrower from Arizona</i> <br><br>  A torch or blowtorch?  A blowtorch - or a dangerous weapon that needs to be banned urgently?  Think of the children, remember the googs and zombies, and be sure to share your opinion in the comments. </div>
