<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kq/em/uo/kqemuoykxvtmv21obdmbd2flupc.jpeg"><br><br>  Recently, hackers laid out in open access to the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/436420/">collection number 1-5</a> - a total of about 2.7 billion accounts with passwords (magnet links: <a href="http://magnet/%3Fxt%3Durn:btih:B39C603C7E18DB8262067C5926E7D5EA5D20E12E">collection number 1</a> , <a href="http://magnet/%3Fxt%3Durn:btih:D136B1ADDE531F38311FBF43FB96FC26DF1A34CD">collection number 2-5</a> ).  For many years these passwords were collected from all available sources, including from Russian sites.  Everyone can check for their password in the database by entering its hash on the <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">Have I Been Pwned</a> website (HIBP) or in the <a href="https://monitor.firefox.com/">Firefox Monitor</a> service.  Now there is another way to do this - through the new <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/password-checkup/pncabnpcffmalkkjpajodfhijclecjno">Password Checkup extension</a> for Chrome. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Password Checkup verifies the authenticity of a password on any site.  If a user enters compromised accounting data somewhere, the extension signals this. <br><br>  Like Firefox Monitor, the extension sends to the server for verification not the password itself, but its hash.  See the detailed <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2019/02/protect-your-accounts-from-data.html">description of the cryptographic scheme</a> , which is schematically shown in the illustration below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/m1/ms/43/m1ms43edoogchfbf2gcqr34iiys.png"><br><br>  Google <a href="https://www.blog.google/technology/safety-security/google-password-checkup-cross-account-protection/">claims</a> that the reconciliation is carried out on the basis of <b>4 billion accounts</b> .  This is more than what HIBP has: it is possible that the company owns a database of passwords that have not yet been made publicly available. <br><br>  Google notes that on its sites, users are protected from leaks automatically.  The company constantly scans the hacker database.  If a password for a Google Account is noticed in any of the leaks, it is automatically deactivated.  This measure has already allowed <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2017/11/new-research-understanding-root-cause.html">ten times to</a> reduce the theft of Google accounts. </div>
