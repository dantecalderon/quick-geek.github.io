<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Introducing the new communication widget for your Wordpress site from the creators of PBX 3CX! <br><br>  Upon entering the site, the visitor has a small widget (communication panel) through which the client can communicate with the staff of your company.  New plugin <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/3cx-clicktotalk/">3CX Live Chat and Talk</a> works with <a href="https://www.3cx.ru/blog/pbx-instance-manager-alpha-2/">3CX v16</a> and higher.  Calls from the plugin are sent to the PBX via the WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) gateway integrated into the PBX, and are completely free. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/19d/f95/5da/19df955daa24768675eb5559c54acc42.png"><br><br><h2>  Features of the 3CX Live Chat and Talk plugin for Wordpress </h2><br><ul><li>  Visitors can communicate both in a chat, and a voice, and even connect video - in one click! <br></li><li>  The plugin is completely free for your company.  No subscription and no hidden fees.  In fact, for a PBX user, this is a free incoming telephone line. <br></li><li>  Connects in a couple of minutes.  Install 3CX&gt; Install Plugin&gt; Communicate. <br></li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f8f/dc9/d18/f8fdc9d18f81658c864bfe343a5dfd47.gif"><br><br>  We tried to implement the widget as simple as possible for the visitor - the latter simply starts a chat, or presses the Audio or Video button - and communicates with your employee (or a group of employees).  No special applications, instant messengers, subscriptions to services, or "callbacks after 30 seconds" (which often simply do not work because of some inconsistency with the employee).  Your own decision on your corporate PBX!  And huge savings on number 0800. <br><br>  The main advantages of the widget from 3CX for your company: <br><br><ul><li>  Simple communications (consultations) with your employees.  One button - and immediately to the sellers. <br></li><li>  Fast communication, without failures and with excellent quality, independent of the service provider, makes the site visitors more loyal. <br></li><li>  A large number of requests are now supported by the updated Queue service in 3CX v16. <br></li></ul><br><ul><li>  Sales managers can respond to a request from the site via 3CX web client or 3CX free apps for iOS and Android. <br></li><li>  The ability to video contact with the user is better suited for solving some problems  This is especially true if the problem is easier to show than to explain (medical problems, equipment malfunctions, etc.). <br></li><li>  The technological advantage of our solution allows you to transfer the conversation from chat to voice communication, and then to video consultation. <br></li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2bf/d9f/af7/2bfd9faf7c07292883fef0af7b274176.png"><br><br><h2>  Install and configure the plugin </h2><br>  To install the plugin, go to the CMS Wordpress management interface and go to Plugins&gt; Add New.  Search for the 3CX Live Chat and Talk plugin and click Install Now.  After the installation is completed, go to the 3CX management interface in the Settings&gt; WordPress&gt; Click2Talk section and enter the URL of your Wordpress site (for example, <a href="https://my-wordpress.company.com/">my-wordpress.company.com</a> , without the “/”) to authorize the communications. <br><br>  Connection security is implemented by the “Maximum allowed requests for IP Address per period” parameter, which limits the number of incoming, but unanswered, chat requests to the extension number 3CX.  The “Request throttle period length, seconds” parameter indicates the period in seconds during which the number of unanswered chat requests is counted. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d47/771/90d/d4777190dd5314116bd499d85d607bf8.png"><br><br><h3>  Creating a Click To Talk object </h3><br>  After installing the plugin on the site, create Click to Call objects.
