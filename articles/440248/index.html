In the latter case, we mean a set of legally relevant electronic documents and relevant data from state information systems.  Currently, the concept of a digital profile is being worked out by the Central Bank and Rostelecom, as reported by Vedomosti. <br><br>  Unfortunately, it is still unknown in what cases a fee will be charged and what its size will be.  Details must determine the government.  The proposal in question is contained in the draft law of the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media, which was discussed by the working group on normative regulation of the Autonomous Non-Profit Organization ‚ÄúDigital Economy‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The representative of the ELN confirmed the discussion of the document, and one of the participants in the working group even concluded that he had familiarized himself with the provision on paid access.  A ministry spokesman Yevgeny Novikov said that the bill contained similar language. <br><br>  Experts say that business already requests personal data of various citizens from GIS.  For example, car sharing services check information about the driver (for example, the relevance of rights and the presence of fines), logistics companies check the TIN of customers.  A passport data of citizens are checked when hiring employees, including the "remote". <br><br>  As for the digital profile, it must provide the business with reliable data about potential customers.  With the appropriate permission of the owners of the data information can be used - for example, when shopping or getting a loan.  This will reduce the operating expenses of the business, and citizens will receive the service faster and cheaper.  If the data is accessed, public services will become easier.  As an example, a notification about the need to extend a document can be sent - it will be sent by a digital profile, with a proposal to submit an application for an update. <br><br>  Now the authors of the concept are discussing the conditions for the commercial provision of data.  There are scenarios for the free use of the system - they are all described in the concept.  Moreover, the paid or free use of the digital profile infrastructure will depend on the entity that requests the information.  The objective of the subject and the requested data themselves will also matter. <br><br>  In the event that information about a citizen is necessary for a company to provide an exclusively commercial service, then the business will have to pay a request for a digital profile.  ANO CE experts suggest that the possibility of a free request for information be clarified in case the company needs user data according to some law.  This could be an anti-money laundering law for banks or a communications law for operators. <br><br>  The business will not pay the user directly, but the operator of the digital profile system.  According to the authors of the concept, this is true, since it is the operator that provides the service and bears the cost of creating and maintaining the infrastructure, both in terms of architectural and software solutions.  The operator can be implemented, for example, in the form of a public-private partnership.  True, experts are skeptical about the possibility of making money for the data owner, that is, for the user. <br><br>  The digital profile will begin to be tested by several banks in September of this year.  Sberbank and VTB have already announced that they will participate in testing. <br><br>  It is worth recalling that, <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/439680/">according to a</a> recent survey, about 50% of Russians are ready to provide personal data for a fee.  The main thing for respondents is the security of their data and the ability to control access to it. <br><br>  Now, the Internet Initiatives Development Fund is working on the implementation of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãrewarding Internet users for using their data.  The IIDF claims that any citizen, if the relevant amendments to the law are adopted, can earn from 15 thousand to 60 thousand rubles a year.  But, as mentioned above, experts doubt that the data owners will receive the money, and not the operator of the same digital profile. <br><br>  At present, responsibility for not too carefully meeting the conditions for safe data storage is not very high.  Last year, only 30 administrative protocols were drawn up in cases where companies were negligent in such situations. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/440248/">https://habr.com/ru/post/440248/</a></p>
