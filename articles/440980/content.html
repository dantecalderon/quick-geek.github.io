<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This post is not about migrating to the cloud or taming floating point numbers.  She is about what men want.  We interviewed 180 guys working in the studio Plarium Krasnodar, and found out that they are usually presented by their close women and what kind of presents the guys really want to receive.  The results may surprise you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bh/dn/ki/bhdnkic_l9kgy61lb7y6-utxgtw.jpeg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  From general to individual </h3><br>  Every year we, girls from the Krasnodar studio Plarium, congratulate our fellow guys on February 23.  Did they all serve in the army?  Not.  But for us this day is first of all the All-Russian men's holiday.  We are preparing a thematic corporate event for children and, of course, we give presents. <br><br>  The advantages of working in large game development studios and IT companies are spacious offices, and a relaxed attitude to the fact that an employee can take a 10–15-minute break, and more than once.  Therefore, in past years we have made the following general gifts: <br><br><ul><li>  kicker; </li><li>  a chest with sports equipment (dumbbells and expanders of various modifications) for use in the office; </li><li>  tennis table; </li><li>  a pool table. </li></ul><br>  But, not surprisingly, the empty space in the office was over, and we thought about individual gifts.  Determined with them was not easy.  The difficulty was that the presents, though for everyone, were the same.  How to please both an artist, a programmer, a tester, and a copywriter with a support manager?  Yes, just do not become attached to gamedev, IT and professions in general!  First of all, they are men, so we decided to donate certificates to the hardware store and ... breakfast, which was waiting for everyone in the workplace :-). <br><br>  It was last year.  We don’t say about gifts to our colleagues this year so as not to spoil.  But if you think that we chose them, having previously interviewed the guys, then you are mistaken.  We conducted the survey after.  Why?  Because the emphasis in it we focused on close women, whose attention is important to every man. <br><br><h3>  Women's choice: perfume, razor and socks </h3><br>  So, first we asked the guys what kind of gifts they usually receive by February 23.  The survey was anonymous.  We offered answers, and also left free space for an answer.  As it turned out, the profession and sphere of activity, indeed, do not particularly affect the choice of gift. <br><br>  The most popular men's gifts that our igrodely receive: <br><br><ul><li>  perfume - 51 answers; </li><li>  shaving accessories (foam, razor, aftershave) - 46 answers; </li><li>  socks - 44 answers. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/30/bj/n4/30bjn4qzgiat8x1yux3tilzmj-g.jpeg"><br><br>  It is noteworthy that the fourth place in popularity (39 votes) was the answer “What I order, I get :-)”.  So, nobody canceled vis lists or direct orders.  It makes life easier for both parties, however, it makes it impossible to make a surprise. <br><br>  And it is significant that in fifth place (31 votes) the answer was “They don’t give me anything :-(. Only at work from female colleagues there are presents.” Another 4 people in the free-answer field were written differently, but about one and the same - they don’t give them anything. It's sad that they are there. Ladies, ay! Your men are in desperate need of attention! <br><br>  What else give men?  Good alcohol and gadgets (29 answers each), a festive breakfast, lunch or dinner (28), certificates to the hardware store (18), books or certificates to the bookstore (also 18), sneakers (17), tool kits (16), cups (14), board games (12). <br><br>  Among the rarest answers (both offered at choice, and written by the guys personally) are subscriptions to the gym, bathing, money, work items, musical instruments, towels, video games, clothing items (scarves, gloves).  And also hassle and sex.  As a gift. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bs/da/lg/bsdalgliktwbchutsbxjcjq2rga.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  “Any present is pleasant” </h3><br>  Now to the preferences.  The survey was also anonymous, so the guys do not hesitate in desires.  The first place personally surprised us.  It turns out that men want elementary attention.  There was this answer: “It doesn't matter what.  Any present is pleasant. ”  So, it was chosen by 39 people. <br><br>  Next in the ranking of answers are: <br><br><ul><li>  books or certificates to the bookstore (18 replies); </li><li>  certificates to the hardware store or gadgets (17 answers); </li><li>  tool kits (12); </li><li>  good alcohol (11); </li><li>  gym tickets (7); </li><li>  Festive breakfast / lunch / dinner (6). </li></ul><br>  Along with good alcohol, 11 votes scored the option “I want to be left alone for at least a day.”  Another person would like a combo - and alcohol, and peace :-).  Do we really get you, gay? <br><br>  And now let's return to the top three leading gifts that children usually give: <br><br><ul><li>  perfume - in fact, only 3 out of 180 people want such a gift; </li><li>  shaving accessories - only 2 people would be happy; </li><li>  socks - the situation is better with them (6 people are not against such a gift). </li></ul><br>  In general, no comment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/du/nx/sy/dunxsyh5gmcintrvrw0uk0eutbk.jpeg"><br><br>  We hope the results of our survey are indicative.  But in order to add representativeness to them, we offer the male audience “Habra” to undergo the same survey.  We will help ladies with gift ideas, even if their men have nothing to do with game dev and IT.  Attention everyone wants the same. </div>
