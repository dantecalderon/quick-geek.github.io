Now imagine a world in which this tiny rice grain can open doors for you, buy groceries and start a car.  This grain is the size of a picture that will replace your giant wallet and keychain with keys.  When you meet someone at an event, using a handshake, you import their contact information into your phone.  In this world, you do not scan a bar code to get to the gym or board the plane, because your rice grain is as unique as the social security number. <a name="habracut"></a>  This little bit also acts as your personal security guarantee: it ensures that no one but you can use your firearms and send your location to your loved ones if you ever get lost. <br><br>  The word "rice grain" sounds incredibly impressive.  The only joke is that you should always have it with you.  How would you track such a tiny thing?  Well, the <a href="https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2018/october/why-implanted-microchips-in-humans-are-about-to-go-big">most obvious solution</a> is to simply implant it under the skin, right between the thumb and forefinger. <br><br>  Now the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa tiny magic seed seems less attractive, isn't it? <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/h1/bg/c_/h1bgc_zx57uurz7hf9mgoswku6s.png" width="600" height="400"></div><br>  At the moment, technology is already available, which embodies all of the above scenarios in life.  This innovation is called a short-range radio frequency identifier ( <abbr title="Radio Frequency Identifier">RFID</abbr> ).  Most likely, you are already using variations of RFID technology in your daily life: for example, a key card that you attach to the sensor to open the door at work.  RFID will also allow you to start a car at the touch of a button. <br><blockquote>  The main feature of RFID is a short range.  If you are not physically close to the object, then this object will not begin to function. </blockquote>  So, if the benefits of this technology are so obvious, then what is the problem?  Human microchipping is pretty creepy.  This is the problem. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xo/tz/wp/xotzwpqtixcukfonroutlw9x0ye.jpeg" width="700" height="400"></div>  <i>Microchip implanted under the skin</i> <br><br><br>  Microchips are associated with many negative stereotypes.  The mere mention of this word conjures up images of a gray, dystopian landscape, where sinister cyborgs with glowing eyes roam the earth in search of people to destroy.  Personally for me, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsubcutaneous implantation causes, to put it mildly, rather unpleasant feelings. <br><br>  The main problem with RFID cards is primarily related to the human factor.  If you lose your RFID card, you will not be able to open the door at work.  If your hands are busy, you will not be able to remove the RFID keys from the backpack to start the car.  In addition, you may have several RFID cards and keys for different needs.  Compared to the RFID card, the microchip implant looks much more attractive.  But the question is: why should it be an implant? <br><br>  I have a ring that my grandmother gave me when I was 15 years old, and I have not removed it from my finger for ten years.  I know a lot of people who have similar items that they never throw out.  Take as an example the piercing.  If the only disadvantage of an RFID microchip is the implant's continuity, why not just attach these RFID chips to rings, bracelets, or piercings? <br><br>  Usability from this is unlikely to decrease, and no subcutaneous implantation procedures will be needed.  In my opinion, this low-tech option is much better suited for most people. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/438720/">https://habr.com/ru/post/438720/</a></p>
