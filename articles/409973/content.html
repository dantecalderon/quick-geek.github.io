<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The theme of cryptocurrency and — more broadly — the blockchain over the past year has been superpopular.  As a result, many humanities scholars (and my students are no exception) scored their term papers, diplomas and dissertations on topics.  But the problem is that serious things on the topic are written with Gulkin's nose, and even in high-rating journals there is often frank nonsense. <br><br>  I sketched a small list of “serious” literature on the blockchain and cryptocurrency for lawyers, economists, and other humanities scholars in Russian — at least to build a framework for understanding the issues.  Of course, there is a lot more literature on the topic, so if you know something sensible that I could miss - send in a personal list, the list is complemented.  Let's start with the works in Russian. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  1.

Work on the economy </h3><br>  <b>2.1.</b>  <b>Murray Rothbard.</b>  <b>State and money</b> <br><br>  Rothbard - American economist of the Austrian school, a follower of von Mises.  This book is a good introduction to monetary issues.  The author shows that money arises during voluntary exchanges in the market, that the state has no relation to their creation, and that the principles of the free market should be extended to the production and distribution of money.  Starting with a review of the classic gold standard of the 19th century, the author completes his study by analyzing the likely appearance of a European currency. <br><br>  <b>2.2.</b>  <b>Ludwig von Mises.</b>  <b>Theory of money and credit</b> <br><br>  Economist of the Austrian school, one of the founders of libertarianism.  In The Theory of Money and Credit, Von Mises works on the theory of money: in particular, the book The Theory of Money and Fiduciary Means of Circulation, in which he substantiated the value of money as an independent class of goods and established an exhaustive typology of money.  The concept of fiduciary means of circulation introduced by Mises made it possible to give an economic and theoretical description of banking.  Of particular interest is the analysis of the effects of inflation. <br><br>  <b>2.3.</b>  <b>Friedrich von Hayek.</b>  <b>Private money</b> <br><br>  Lauret of the Nobel Prize and another representative of the Austrian school.  In his most famous work, he proposed to denationalize money and create a monetary system based on the competition of parallel private currencies.  According to Hayek, just as the competition between ordinary goods contributes to the improvement of their consumer properties, the competition between private currencies will reject bad — insufficiently secured and poorly managed — currencies.  Von Hayek can be considered an economist who theoretically substantiated the imminent emergence of private money, including cryptocurrency. <br><br>  <b>2.4.</b>  <b>Genkin A.S.</b>  <b>Private money: history and modernity</b> <b><br></b>  <b>2.5.</b>  <b>Genkin, Mikheev.</b>  <b>Blockchain: How it works and what awaits us tomorrow</b> <br><br>  It is good to read after Hayek and other economists of the Austrian school - many modern examples and additional literature are cited.  The legal component of the second work is weak, you should not rely on it. <br><br><h3>  3. Works by law </h3><br><h4>  3.1.  General issues of the legal theory of money </h4><br>  <b>3.1.1.</b>  <b>Luntz L. A. Money and monetary obligations in civil law</b> <br><br>  Until now - the best work on the issue of the legal regime of means of payment and cash surrogates.  Classic!

Adaptation of Original Theories of Money in the Civil Law of the 20th Century</b> <br><br>  Maxim Leonidovich wrote a lot about the legal nature of money and now deals with this issue at the HSE Institute of Law and Development.  I advise you to get acquainted with his works. <br><br><h3>  3.2.
