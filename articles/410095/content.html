This, for the most part, means that information in the system is transmitted in blocks of 64 bits.  Nevertheless, the processors with a different architecture have not yet gone into another world.  There are even new instances - however, they are created by enthusiasts for some of their goals.  Previously, one of the most famous eight-bit processors was the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/8008">Intel 8008</a> , which appeared in the early 1970s. <br><br>  Of course, those processors are rather primitive in comparison with modern ones, but they performed their work as “excellent”.  The other day, the network got information about an 8-bit processor collected from scrap materials, which functions without problems, although it looks a bit strange.  It was created by YouTube user Paulo Constantino (Paulo Constantino). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At first glance, the development of Constantino looks like a collection of wires (at a second glance, too).  But the structure includes not only the wires.  The processor is mounted on a circuit board, which allows you to create layouts of a variety of schemes - from the simplest to Samha complex. <br><br>  According to Constantino, he initially developed a scheme on paper, it took him two days.  Then, having started the installation, he had to spend about a week on the job.  During the installation, he used various kinds of switches to make the created circuit work like a real processor. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g_ZaioqF1B0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Its processor can play the theme from Mario, but it’s quite difficult to program the system.  The problem is that the keyboard is not connected to the system, so everything must be done manually.  After some time, the developer plans to add a keyboard to make it easier to work.  Then the processor will be able to show everything that it is capable of. <br><br>  The 8-bit processor is an interesting project, but the most ambitious work of this kind is the <a href="http://www.megaprocessor.com/">Megaprocessor</a> .  It is a 16-bit processor with four general-purpose registers.  On separate panels are placed circuits for various purposes, including memory, arithmetic unit, input / output and some others.  This system uses a 16-bit ALU block and a 16-bit adder.  Megaprocessor is equipped with 10,000 LEDs, the blinking of which shows each stage of the calculation process, showing the direction the data is moving according to the scheme.  Memory capacity is 256 bytes. <br><br>  The circuit used more than 27,000 transistors - this is only for the memory block.  The total number of transistors in this system is over 40 thousand.  The mass of the processor that operates at a frequency of 20 kilohertz is 500 kilograms. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z71h9XZbAWY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The author of this development is an electronics engineer from the UK.  His name is James Newman.  Somehow he wanted to understand the smallest details in the principle of the process.  Well, the best way to do this is to assemble a processor with your own hands. <br><br>  “Computers are opaque.  Looking at them, it is impossible to understand how they work.  What I wanted to do was get inside and see what was going on.  The problem is that this is not possible with regular-sized processors.  But we can build a large processor with our own hands - and then it will be clear what is happening inside.  In order to display data streams, it is worth adding LEDs - which was done, ” <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/278410/">says</a> James Newman.  Now the work of the Megaprocessor can be monitored in real time, and anyone can understand what elements the processor consists of and how each unit works. <br><br>  You can use the processor for various purposes, but the engineer chose the game Tetris in order to show the principle of the whole system.  During the game, all processes that occur during the operation of the system are shown in real time using indicators.  The number of various connections in the system exceeds 100,000. <br><br>  Newman spent nearly 40,000 pounds sterling on his project.  Now, perhaps, already and more, as he constantly continues to improve the system. <br><br>  Initially it seemed to the engineer that he would be able to realize his project in a year.  But I had to spend more than five years, despite the fact that Megaprocessor continues to improve. </div>
