It is a client derived from DC ++ and is based on the source code ApexDC ++ 0.4.0 (up to and including r4xx) and StrongDC ++ 2.42 (starting from r5xx).  BitTorrent support is implemented using the libtorrent library. </blockquote><br><h4>  Preface, it's an epilogue </h4><br>  The article is written as a detailed response to the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/438264/">comment</a> .  The developer of FlylinkDC ++ was informed about the presence of all the phenomena described below and confirmed that all of them (except reason # 2, but this is not accurate) were intentionally introduced into the client. <br><br><h4>  So, reason number 1 </h4><br>  FlylinkDC ++ has a server part, from where a part of its <a href="">settings is</a> loaded, which are not editable. <br><br>  Some of these settings are responsible for the <u>substitution of</u> hub addresses to which the user connects. <br><br>  The substitution is carried out, firstly, on the fly using Ctrl + Q, and, secondly, in the Favorite list.  That is, write one address, get another. <br><br>  Also recorded a <u>remote change in the</u> list of Favorite hubs after updating the client.  Specifically - for the autoconnect, <a href="https://github.com/pavel-pimenov/flylinkdc-r5xx/issues/1714">this hub</a> was added <a href="https://github.com/pavel-pimenov/flylinkdc-r5xx/issues/1714">there</a> .  Then <a href="https://dchublist.ru/hubs/ozerki/">another</a> .  And further. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/z-/jd/tl/z-jdtlm9cj4bbsnclhe0wobi1mw.png"><br>  <i>So adding to Favorites through remote config affects the attendance of the hub</i> <br><br>  This is done on a commercial basis, costs 30 euros per month per hub. <br><br><pre><code class="plaintext hljs">promo_hubs_plus="dchub://piter.feardc.net,dchub://dc.ozerki.pro,dchub://motivation.pp.ua"</code> </pre> <br>  In other words, there is actually a <u>blocking of the</u> hubs on the client side (!?) And the <u>translation</u> (not to be confused with the redirect) of users from one resource to another. <br><br><h4>  Reason # 2 </h4><br>  FlylinkDC ++ has a massive problem with filelist return with a non-zero ball;  it is downloaded empty. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kx/7a/m8/kx7am8p0rohdonxvmnjh5fbqjai.png"><br><br><h4>  Reason number 3 </h4><br>  FlylinkDC ++ is <a href="http://www.flylinkdc.ru/2016/04/blog-post.html">adapted</a> to install two or more connections to the same hub, thereby increasing the load on the server and itself and forging resource statistics.  Such situations often arise because of # 1. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ir/xy/vm/irxyvmxnywqy20_5b3jgpfxypnc.png"><br>  <i>The "clones" in this screenshot are not hub errors due to incorrectly closed connections.</i> <br><br>  According to my <a href="https://drive.google.com/open%3Fid%3D15zKdZpBIj6Q5yve7EYZdHk-vSnWrt3vb">calculations</a> , FlylinkDC ++ double connects make up from 10 to 40 (!) Percent of users of the three largest DC hubs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/c6/4u/vu/c64uvudamdg4wbiyabezscics-s.png"><br>  <i>Double connections are highlighted in red.</i> <br><br><h4>  Reason # 4 </h4><br>  By default, the client <u>denies secure connections</u> (!) And allows normal <u>connections</u> , which actually makes it a parasite on ADCs hubs. <br><br><h4>  Reason # 5 </h4><br>  FlylinkDC ++ does not allow the use of lists of hubs other than those wired into it with the help of a remote config. <br><br><h4>  Bonus </h4><br>  <a href="http://www.flylinkdc.ru/2017/10/1000.html">Unsubscribe</a> in the best traditions of the RKN. </div>
