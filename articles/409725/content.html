<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gu/sr/im/gusrimpyw-bn3fccblry-le3gpq.jpeg"></p><br><p>  The year 2018 has come, and the cryptocurrency market has still not collapsed, the bitcoin bubble has not burst, companies such as Telegram and Kodak are planning to enter the ICO.  Companies that have an IPO do not want to dwell on this and go on the ICO, for example, the German Fintech-based company Naga group, listed on the German stock exchange in Frankfurt.  She conducted the fastest German IPO in 15 years, and also conducted a successful ICO. </p><br><p>  The market continues to develop, despite the problems.  In the new year, there are new projects with a good idea and a business model that may interest not only experienced investors in ICO and cryptocurrency, but also newcomers in the crypto market who are currently investing only in Ether, Ripple and other obvious assets.  I want to highlight several ICO-projects that may deserve attention. </p><br><p><a name="habracut"></a>  To select a promising ICO, you need to evaluate the project from different angles, starting with the site and White Paper, ending with the business model, relevance and use of the project token. </p><br><h2 id="kodakonehttpskodakcoincom">  <a href="https://kodakcoin.com/">KODAKOne</a> </h2><br><p>  One of the most famous manufacturers of photographic equipment around the world announced the launch of ICO on January 31, 2018, having blown up the news from crypto devices.  I can not mention their ICO in my review. </p><br><h4 id="biznes-model">  Business model </h4><br><p>  The KODAK company (a world-wide producer of photographic equipment) announced the creation of KODAKOne, a blockchain image management platform, with Kodak Coin domestic currency.  The platform will allow cheap and fast to register, move and sell digital images.  KodakOne offers a simple blockchain-based licensing and payment system using smart contracts. </p><br><h4 id="token">  Token </h4><br><ul><li>  Utilty token. </li><li>  Internal currency of the platform. </li></ul><br><h4 id="preimuschestva">  Benefits </h4><br><ul><li>  A legendary company whose token can grow only through Kodak's reputation. </li><li>  Target audience of photographers who are genuinely interested in the development of the project. </li><li>  Efficiency and transparency of the platform. </li></ul><br><h4 id="nedostatki">  disadvantages </h4><br><ul><li>  Too optimistic attitude of investors to the project, which may lead to unreasonable inflation of the price of the token. </li></ul><br><h4 id="verdikt">  Verdict </h4><br><p>  Kodak definitely deserves the attention of any investor.  The company's long-term experience in the global market is a reason enough for the continued success of the project.  Tokens will be in demand on the platform, as it solves many problems of photographers - the target audience of the project. </p><br><ul><li>  Big potential. </li><li>  High level of trust in the project. </li><li>  The optimal share of tokens in the portfolio is 15%. </li></ul><br><h4 id="data">  date </h4><br><p>  January 31 - ICO. </p><br><h2 id="safinushttpswwwsafinuscom">  <a href="https://www.safinus.com/">Safinus</a> </h2><br><p>  At the beginning of 2018, there were not so many fintech projects that go to the ICO.  At the same time, there is a huge amount of decentralized platforms for games, crowdfunding, real estate, information storage and even for energy, which also deserve attention.  But it is difficult to determine which project to consider first. </p><br><p>  One of the reasons why I chose this platform is that ICO projects that help develop cryptoindustry demonstrate the best financial performance and survival.  Besides, I myself am interested to try their platform on myself. </p><br><h4 id="biznes-model-1">  Business model </h4><br><p>  The main objective of the project is to create a platform where beginners can safely invest in cryptoactive assets by joining profitable investment portfolios, and experienced traders will increase the amount of funds managed and their profits. </p><br><p>  The idea of ​​the project is that on the platform professional investors (portfolio managers) will be able to create investment portfolios consisting of cryptocurrencies and ICO.  At the same time, beginners can choose an experienced trader's portfolio that is suitable for profitability and conditions and join it with their own funds, and then make a profit commensurate with the investments. </p><br><p>  All ICOs placed on the platform will be selected by the participants by a vote, this will eliminate unscrupulous market participants and increase investment security. </p><br><h4 id="token-saf">  SAF Token </h4><br><ul><li>  Utility token. </li><li>  200 SAF tokens make it possible to open a portfolio on the platform. </li></ul><br><h4 id="preimuschestva-1">  Benefits </h4><br><ul><li>  The platform offers a quality solution to the problems of the target audience: experienced market participants and newcomers, which will positively affect the demand for platform services. </li><li>  The implementation of its decentralized exchange. </li><li>  High popularity and profitability fintech projects. </li></ul><br><h4 id="nedostatki-1">  disadvantages </h4><br><ul><li>  The presence of existing competitors with a similar business model.  However, the proposed platform functionality should enable the project to successfully gain its niche in the market. </li></ul><br><h4 id="verdikt-1">  Verdict </h4><br><p>  The Safinus project attracts attention with the proposed solutions to the problems of the target audience.  The fiduciary mechanism, the voting system can solve many problems of experienced investors, professionals and novice investors. </p><br><ul><li>  Big potential. </li><li>  Presumably high yield fintech projects. </li><li>  The optimal share of tokens in the portfolio is 5-10%. </li></ul><br><h4 id="data-1">  date </h4><br><p>  January 23 - pre-sale. </p><br><h2 id="lalaworldhttpslalaworldio">  <a href="https://lalaworld.io/">Lalaworld</a> </h2><br><p>  It is worth noting that global fintech projects very often attract the attention of investors, since the profitability of such tokens is very often high. </p><br><p>  Consider the LalaWorld project, whose ICO began on January 5, 2018.  The company has successfully completed not only the pre-sale, but also the ICO campaign as soon as possible. </p><br><h4 id="biznes-model-2">  Business model </h4><br><p>  The main goal of the project is to create an ecosystem that will open access to financial and banking services to migrants and people who are now unbanked, and also allow them to create a community conducive to solving not only financial, but also everyday life problems.  The project creates not only an electronic wallet, but also its own hardware (smartphone, sim card and debit card). </p><br><h4 id="token-lala">  Token lala </h4><br><ul><li>  Utility token. </li><li>  Provides bonuses and discounts to members. </li><li>  Gives benefits to partners. </li><li>  Used in P2P lending. </li><li>  Will grow as the project develops. </li></ul><br><h4 id="preimuschestva-2">  Benefits </h4><br><ul><li>  Wide target audience (2 billion people worldwide). </li><li>  High-quality integrated solution of Central Asian problems. </li><li>  Creating your own hardware. </li></ul><br><h4 id="nedostatki-2">  disadvantages </h4><br><ul><li>  High risks associated with the activities of counterparties. </li><li>  High legal risks. </li><li>  Low target audience literacy. </li></ul><br><h4 id="tekuschaya-situaciya">  Current situation </h4><br><p>  The company's crowdsale was supposed to last until February, however, due to a well-conducted marketing campaign and high prospects for the ICO project, it ended on January 14th.  However, it is worth noting that LalaWorld has several competitors with a similar token. </p><br><p>  Almost all of their tokens show significant growth by January 2018.  From an analysis of the price dynamics of competing tokens, it can be concluded that a Lala token may have a similar trend.  In this case, it makes sense to purchase a token after its appearance on a crypto-exchange. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/by/nk/m6/bynkm6i5hvkd2u_smtalxy-wjvo.png"></p><br><h4 id="verdikt-2">  Verdict </h4><br><p>  Despite the fact that the ICO project is completed, you can think about buying tokens on cryptobirds.  The project LaLa World is very global, aimed at solving not only economic, but also social problems.  It is worth noting that the project has a strong team and a large affiliate network.  The project looks promising and investment attractive. </p><br><ul><li>  Big potential. </li><li>  High level of risk. </li><li>  The optimal share of tokens in the investor’s portfolio is 5–10%. </li></ul><br><h4 id="data-2">  date </h4><br><p>  ICO completed (20.2 million USD). </p><br><h2 id="bluzellehttpsbluzellecom">  <a href="https://bluzelle.com/">Bluzelle</a> </h2><br><h4 id="biznes-model-3">  Business model </h4><br><p>  The project involves the creation of a decentralized database on the blockchain, to which any PC owner can connect.  By renting space on your PC, you can earn project tokens, and product consumers will pay for placing information and data in the project system. </p><br><h4 id="token-blz">  Token blz </h4><br><ul><li>  Utility token </li><li>  Exchange for internal BNT token. </li></ul><br><h4 id="token-bnt">  BNT Token </h4><br><ul><li>  Internal platform token, faster and cheaper. </li><li>  Payment method on the platform. </li></ul><br><h4 id="preimuschestva-3">  Benefits </h4><br><ul><li>  Faster and cheaper transactions on the platform. </li><li>  Privacy guarantee. </li><li>  High reliability. </li><li>  Low cost (computer resources of the participants). </li></ul><br><h4 id="nedostatki-3">  disadvantages </h4><br><ul><li>  A large number of competitors. </li><li>  The complexity of the joint operation of the two tokens can scare off investors. </li></ul><br><h4 id="verdikt-3">  Verdict </h4><br><p>  The system of two tokens, proposed by the Bluzelle project, should significantly reduce the cost and simplify the process of storing and managing information.  It is worth noting that the White List of the project is already closed.  Everything suggests that the project is likely to collect the planned amount, and the project tokens will be in demand. </p><br><ul><li>  Big potential. </li><li>  The optimal share of tokens in the portfolio is 5%. </li></ul><br><h4 id="data-3">  date </h4><br><p>  January 18 - ICO (1 group White list). </p><br><h2 id="ink-protocolhttpspaywithinkcom">  <a href="https://paywithink.com/">Inc protocol</a> </h2><br><p>  Another decentralized platform, which this time is the marketplace.  The project raised $ 3.5 million in a closed pre-sale. </p><br><h4 id="biznes-model-4">  Business model </h4><br><p>  On a decentralized platform, buyers and sellers can view counterparty ratings, use escrow services.  Ink Protocol positions itself as a platform for any peer-2-peer transactions.  The platform can be integrated into any marketplace. </p><br><h4 id="token-1">  Token </h4><br><ul><li>  Utility token. </li><li>  Internal currency of the platform. </li></ul><br><h4 id="preimuschestva-4">  Benefits </h4><br><ul><li>  The relevance of decentralization in the marketplace. </li><li>  High-quality integrated solution of marketplace problems. </li><li>  The ability to integrate the platform on all existing marketplaces. </li></ul><br><h4 id="nedostatki-4">  disadvantages </h4><br><ul><li>  A large number of competitors that can slow down the development of the platform. </li></ul><br><h4 id="verdikt-4">  Verdict </h4><br><p>  The Ink Protocol project offers a comprehensive solution to the existing problems of marketplaces related to fraudulent activities.  Moreover, the integration of this platform into already existing marketplace can ensure the successful functioning of the platform and its popularity, which will lead to an increase in the token. </p><br><ul><li>  Great project potential. </li><li>  Perhaps a significant expansion of users of the platform. </li><li>  The optimal share of tokens in the portfolio is 10%. </li></ul><br><h4 id="data-4">  date </h4><br><p>  January 22 - pre-sale. </p><br><p>  Private sale completed (3 500 000 USD). </p><br><h2 id="vyvod">  Conclusion </h2><br><p>  So, the ICO market, despite some decline at the end of 2017 and the beginning of 2018, continues to grow at an astronomical pace.  There is a huge number of new projects, and some of them deserve the attention of investors. </p><br><p>  I tried to highlight several projects in 2018 that promise to be promising.  However, it is worth remembering that investments in a cryptocurrency market have an increased risk.  Therefore, when investing in an ICO, you should be extremely careful not to run into a dummy project. </p></div>
