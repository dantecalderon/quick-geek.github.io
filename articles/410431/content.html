Among other cool models, the "banana" <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_8110">Nokia 8110</a> , a model released more than 20 years ago, was also mentioned.  It was this phone that the Chosen One from the Matrix received in an envelope when he was working in his office.  Actually, the storyline started with this.  It is clear that the sales of the phone after the release of the film increased several times, and this model has become extremely popular. <br><br>  Now the owner of the Nokia brand and the rights to previously released models are owned by HMD Global.  It was her leadership who decided to revive the almost legendary phone, which is discussed above.  The price tag will be quite democratic.  For a device with a 4G communication module and a number of other modern systems, the company will ask for 79 euros (about $ 97). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The updated model will be available in two colors.  The first is “banana yellow” and the second is the usual black color.  For HMD Global, it’s not for the first time to attract the attention of customers by the release of modified mobile phone models that were once very popular.  Last year, the same company introduced a modified version of the Nokia 3310. It was then that Samsung had a fiasco with its new flagships, whose batteries began to explode (very rarely, but it was enough for hype).  Therefore, phone buyers began to look for new options, and here came <s>Nokia</s> HMD Global. <br><br>  This year, Samsung has introduced a new flagship, the Samsung S9, at the MWC in Barcelona, ​​so HMD Global has received less attention.  But all the same, around the stand of the company there were crowds of visitors who were impatient to try out the new product.  The company, which employs a large number of ex-employees from Nokia and Microsoft, announced that it managed to ship 70 million phones last year and capture about 1% of the smartphone market in the fourth quarter of 2017. <br><br>  And this is a great indicator.  For example, the same corporation Samsung last year shipped 317 million different models of their phones.  And the Chinese company Xiaomi - 92 million.  Thus, HMD gradually begins to seize the market, and it may well be that it will be able to increase sales figures thanks to the announcements of such modified heretofore popular devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cf9/283/75c/cf928375cbc5a818da2488b79c9dab32.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to the "banana", the company introduced four other models of devices, each of which stands out with something - ceramic inserts, an aluminum case or something else.  And the cost of phones from HMD is much lower than that of many other companies, if we take the equivalent characteristics. <br><br>  The Finnish company Nokia sold its mobile phone division to Microsoft in 2013.  At the same time the pool of patents connected with the development of the Finns was sold.  The purchase price was only 5 billion US dollars, and the Redmond giant paid for patents for a little more than 2 billion dollars.  It was planned that the transaction on the sale of mobile business will be closed in March 2014, but in fact it was possible to do this only on April 25.  Over time, Microsoft abandoned the use of the Nokia brand, and replaced it with its own Microsoft Lumia brand. <br><br>  Why does HMD Global work on Nokia phones?  The fact is that this Finnish company bought out part of the Microsoft Mobile business in 2016 and declared itself the successor of the Nokia mobile phone business.  We are talking about the production of simple push-button phones, not advanced smartphones.  Microsoft decided to sell this business, since the direction was not the main strategic goal and is not a necessary part of Microsoft’s business.  HMD and Nokia Corporation have signed an agreement that provides the exclusive right to use the Nokia brand on mobile phones and tablets throughout the world for the next decade and gives the right (license) to use Nokia Corporation patents for cellular standards. <br><br>  The deal was closed in December 2016.  Many ex-Nokia employees who once made the company one of the leaders in the mobile device market work here.  In 2017, the company, in addition to the updated version of the Nokia 3310, released two models of smartphones with the names Nokia 5 and Nokia 3. The first one is a middle-class device, its diagonal is 5.2 inches.  Nokia 3 is a mid-budget phone. </div>
