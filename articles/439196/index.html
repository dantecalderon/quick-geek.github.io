According to analysts of the investment bank JPMorgan, <a href="https://hello.iticapital.ru/iti-global%26ticker%3DNFLX%3Futm_source%3Dmail%26utm_medium%3Dlink%26utm_campaign%3Dhabr">Netflix</a> , <a href="https://hello.iticapital.ru/iti-global%26ticker%3DATVI%3Futm_source%3Dmail%26utm_medium%3Dlink%26utm_campaign%3Dhabr">Blizzard</a> and <a href="https://hello.iticapital.ru/iti-global%26ticker%3DSONO%3Futm_source%3Dmail%26utm_medium%3Dlink%26utm_campaign%3Dhabr">Sonos</a> may be among the suitable acquisitions for Apple, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-04/apple-acquisition-targets-could-include-netflix-sonos-jpmorgan%3Fsrnd%3Ddeals">writes</a> . <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Why Apple investors are unhappy </h2><br>  Since October 2018, when <a href="https://hello.iticapital.ru/iti-global%26ticker%3Daapl%3Futm_source%3Dmail%26utm_medium%3Dlink%26utm_campaign%3Dhabr">Apple shares</a> set a record in value, their price fell by more than 25%.  This contributes to the declining demand for new iPhone.  In a recent report, Apple announced the first drop in sales since 2001 - all because of worsened sales of smartphones. <br><br>  Considering this fact, as well as Apple‚Äôs having $ 130 billion of free money on accounts - apart from an annual profit of $ 45 billion after deducting dividends - the company's investors hope that the company uses its resources to protect the business. <br><br>  JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee (Samik Chatterjee) in his note indicates that currently there are not accurate data on upcoming acquisitions, but such transactions could help the company to raise the value of the shares. <br><br><h2>  Who can buy Apple, and is it really? </h2><br>  In turn, the purchase of a company from the development of games will allow Apple to "use the turn of this industry towards the mobile segment."  This should contribute to another round of changes in the requirements for the hardware of games.  According to analysts, Activision Blizzard could be the best choice for Apple.  Its capitalization is $ 35.1 billion. <br><br>  According to analysts at JPMorgan, video games, video content and smart home gadgets are in the list of strategically important industries for Apple - it is the development in these areas that will promote growth and make more active use of the existing customer base. <br><br>  Netflix video streaming service was recognized as ‚Äúthe best choice for Apple from a strategic point of view,‚Äù since its acquisition will allow the company to grow more actively at the expense of content consumers on mobile devices.  However, it is noted that it will not be so easy to buy Netflix - the company's capitalization is $ 148.4 billion. <br><br>  Smart home speakers allow you to ‚Äúfocus on high user engagement‚Äù and are also useful for ‚Äúpromoting the Apple Music service.‚Äù  According to analysts, at the moment Apple lags behind competitors in the category of products for smart home.  At the same time, Sonos products have an excellent reputation in the market and high user loyalty, its gadgets are perceived as more premium competitors to Amazon Alexa and Google Home.  In addition, the company sells its devices worldwide.  Its capitalization is "only" $ 1.2 billion. <br><br>  Despite the recommendations of analysts and investors' concerns, usually Apple is not very actively investing in purchases.  Only two cases of acquisitions made by public companies are known: in 2014, Beats Electronics was bought for $ 3 billion, and Apple along with other companies participated in the acquisition of Toshiba Memory Corp for $ 18 billion. <br><br><h2>  Other materials on finance and stock market from <a href="https://iticapital.ru/">ITI Capital</a> : </h2><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://hello.iticapital.ru/">Western securities analysis tool</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://iticapital.ru/research-education/research/">Analytics and market reviews</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://iticapital.ru/shares/american-shares/">Purchase of shares of American companies from Russia</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/iticapital/blog/419213/">Huawei overtook Apple in terms of sales.</a>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/iticapital/blog/419213/">The capitalization of the American company still reached $ 1 trillion</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/iticapital/blog/418605/">Analysts: Microsoft's capitalization could reach $ 1 trillion</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/iticapital/blog/417587/">Mass media: large-scale cyber attacks accelerated the growth of capitalization of companies from the information security industry</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/iticapital/blog/416457/">Bloomberg: Hedge Funds Recognize Brexit Results Before Others And Earn Billions</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/439196/">https://habr.com/ru/post/439196/</a></p>
