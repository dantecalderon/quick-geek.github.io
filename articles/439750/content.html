<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  It is no secret that tech companies are starving wildly at good grocery shots.  In San Francisco, when you go to work even for an individual contributor position, you often get a bonus for signing an offer in the amount of $ 5 to $ 25 thousand, not to mention the share in the company. </p><br><p>  The good news is that because of this, product training programs hire excellent mentors, compete on content quality and generously subsidize the cost of training. </p><br><p>  Below is a selection of several courses where you can upgrade your product skills. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://productuniversity.ru/product-manager"><strong>Product University</strong></a> (Free, 2 months, Russian).  Arkady Moreynis's free acceleration program (@temno) without interrupting work.  Payment for the course - after employment in the grocery company.  An offer that cannot be refused. </li><li>  <a href="http://productstar.ru/"><strong>Product Star</strong></a> ($ 180- $ 440, 2 months, Russian).  Course author Misha Karpov (Skyeng) with a bunch of classroom mentors and teachers. </li><li>  <a href="https://simulator.gopractice.ru/"><strong>Go Practice</strong></a> (Estimates: ~ $ 530, ~ 2 months, Russian).  Online course from Oleg Yakubenkov (ex Facebook) with real cases involving game mechanics and subsidies in case of employment. </li><li>  <a href="https://productsense.io/mindset"><strong>Product Mindset</strong></a> (Free, 2 months, Russian).  Online program for the development of grocery thinking for very beginners.  Nobody talks about employment, but there are mentors (alas, I donâ€™t know any of them) and a ticket to the afterparty conference. </li><li>  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/product-management"><strong>Product Management @ Coursera</strong></a> ($ 49 / month, 4 months, English).  If you are doing well with concentration and you can get things done, a great low-cost program from the University of Alberta, Canada. </li><li>  <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/product-management"><strong>Product Management @ General Assembly</strong></a> ($ 3,950, 2.5 months - online, 1 week - intensive, English).  GA is an advanced training for millenials.  Gold standard in the USA.  I personally know a couple of instructors, great people. </li><li>  <a href="https://executive.berkeley.edu/programs/product-management"><strong>Product Management @ Berkeley</strong></a> ($ 7,950, 5 days, intensive on campus Berkeley, California, English).  Perhaps, for the majority it is overkill, but if you want the Berkliykh regalia and you can afford it, then a very good course.  The creator is a professor at Berkeley Haas Business School, a fan of design thinking, PhD at Stanford. </li></ul><br><hr><br><p>  Compiled by Alexey Ivanov ( <a href="https://tele.click/ponchiknews">@PonchikNews</a> ). </p></div>
