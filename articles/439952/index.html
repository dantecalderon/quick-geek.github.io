This desire arose from the fact that I love to read, and there are simply no normal book aggregators in the vast Russian Internet.  Actually, from the pain of searching for something to read and trying to recall the name of the book that I read recently and on which chapter I stopped, the desire was born to make a web application in which all this would be possible and convenient.  It should be noted that no experience in development, programming, etc.  I did not have, my work is not connected with it at all.  Nevertheless, desire overcame laziness and turned into concrete actions, a kind of hobby. <br><br>  I will not tell you how I studied javascript, node.js, react, html, css, etc., let's go to what I have come to at the moment, what I would like to share with you and, of course, listen to constructive criticism of experts. <br><br>  Like many, I trained on my own PC on localhost: 3000, created front / back-ends, installed, worked with api, etc., but I was always worried about how to transfer all this to hosting?  Will it work?  Do I need to rewrite the code because of this?  <b>And most importantly, is it possible to set everything up so that I can work on the application from any PC and easily transfer everything to hosting on production?</b>  <b>I'll tell you about it.</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Hosting selection </h2><br>  I was ready to spend $ 10 a month for my hobby, so I chose the hosting I planned to stay with in the future.  As I said, before that I had 0 experience, including hosting sites.  I tried and refused the following: <br><br>  <b>Jelastic</b> : beautiful and user-friendly interface, everything seems to be intuitive, scalable and understandable.  Nevertheless, I encountered difficulties in setting up (for some reason, nginx from vps did not want to work, only with their own module) and connecting SSL (and automatic updating) to the Russian-language domain using standard tools (they promised to fix it, but I don’t want to wait) <br><br>  <b>REG.RU cloud hosting</b> : I have the domain right there, so the solution seemed logical, but they didn’t have a separately configured PostgreSQL, and since I didn’t want to get involved with the administration of the database, I began to search further. <br><br>  <b>AWS and Google clouds</b> : I tried, everything seems to be fine, but I remembered our "wonderful" laws and the requirement to stir user data on servers in the Russian Federation.  Unfortunately, these guys did not have servers in the Russian Federation.  Not a lawyer, but from sin I decided to look for clouds with servers in the Russian Federation.  <b>If your application is unlikely to have problems with the law, then a good choice.</b> <br><br>  Although there were clouds with servers in the Russian Federation, I still wanted something that would save me from having to dive into the administration of PostgreSQL.  A gust stumbled a bit on <a href="https://cloud.yandex.ru/">Yandex.Oblaka</a> , which had recently become available, tried it, everything seemed simple and convenient, so I stopped on them for now.  It should be noted that PostgreSQL hosting at them immediately comes from 1core and 4GB of RAM, which is about 2k rubles per month, so for the development time and low load I plan to run PostgreSQL on VPS for ~ 300r, and with increasing load, transfer the base and let Yandex administers and updates. <br><br><h2>  Configuring Yandex. Cloud </h2><br><h3>  Virtual Private Cloud </h3><br>  1) Create a directory for your site: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/35e/3de/581/35e3de5819d0344d34cc9a03251cbf65.png" alt="image"><br><br>  2) Create a Virtual Private Cloud: <br><br>  The main thing that he gives for me at the current stage is the IP for accessing the created resource from the outside.  I got acquainted with subnets, zones, isolation and fault tolerance superficially, if necessary, I will make it up. <br><br>  3) Create a subnet and assign it an internal IP (as I understand it, this is about how a local network) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f25/42d/f6c/f2542df6c7141d6e96738f6f1d3e6cf1.png" alt="image"><br><br>  4) Go to the IP tab and reserve yourself a static IP. <br><br>  According to it, we will connect from home and other places.  It is probably possible to work with dynamic, but I did not understand when it changes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/47c/ef6/265/47cef626515785d83ba86cb6f5f8c185.png" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Compute cloud </h3><br>  Here we will have calculations :) That is, we will create a Linux virtual machine (I chose ubuntu 18.04), install the node.js application and postgreSQL. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/265/293/e0c/265293e0c462dd9dd2452874799c2157.png" alt="image"><br><br>  We press to create a VM, we unscrew all the settings to a minimum, since there will be no load during development (when our application comes out, then we will tighten up more, well, we will monitor them on schedules). <br><br><h4>  Ssh </h4><br>  The problem point I encountered at this stage is SSH: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/687/476/389/68747638934544e751f6a0b21f43e683.png" alt="image"><br><br>  What it is and why I had no idea, so I went to study.  It turned out - this is just an access method, but not by the password, but by the generated SSH key.  To actually generate it, download and install <a href="https://www.putty.org/">Putty</a> as we are advised. <br><br>  Run C: \ Program Files \ PuTTY \ puttygen.exe <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/333/03a/e02/33303ae02d9b14983cf0627087dfd8ee.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Press the Generate button and move the mouse to give randomness to the generated key (as I understood it).  Next, copy the appeared line starting with ssh-rsa somewhere in a text file and click Save private key, Save public key.  The key copied to a text file is inserted into the SSH key of the Yandex open page.  Login is root, otherwise you will not have access when working with the graphic file system of the application via which you will connect to the cloud from home / work (perhaps there is a way, but I did not understand). <br>  <b>As noted by andreymal, it is better not to use root, so that Chinese bots do not pick up the password to your cloud, but since Yandex.Cloud access is only via SSH, you can live like.</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>The application on the hosting is worth running exclusively non-root user, so as not to allow attackers to run malicious code through possible vulnerabilities in your application.</b> <b><br></b> <br><br><h3>  Connect to the cloud from a PC and choose a free SSH client </h3><br>  Standard Putty allows you to work only with the command line, and since my windows user is unusual, I started looking for a client with a pseudo-conductor.  At first, I tried Mobaxterm, but after some idle time it turns off, the explorer hangs altogether, so now I work with <a href="https://www.bitvise.com/download-area">bitvise ssh</a> and I don’t observe any problems like Mobaxterm. <br><br><h3>  Setting up bitvise ssh </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8a2/019/f4c/8a2019f4cafa7b44ef72286664175010.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Here in the Server&gt; Host field we indicate our external IP clouds.  Port 22. Click the client key manager&gt; import and specify in it the generated Putty previously private key.  You may still need a key phrase, choose something that you will not forget.  We close this window and in the authentication field we specify username: root, method publick key, client key - select the one imported earlier.  We press login and if we did everything correctly, then connect to the cloud: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b4b/e6a/a9d/b4be6aa9df15651829c0b23749f18b41.png" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Install Node.js </h2><br>  Here I recommend using digitalocean.com instructions, they are very detailed and many are in Russian.  I usually google “digitalocean ubuntu 18.04 node.js” or whatever you want to install or configure. <br><br>  How to install Node.js can be read <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-node-js-application-for-production-on-ubuntu-18-04">here</a> . <br><br>  If it is short, then we come on <a href="https://github.com/nodesource/distributions">nodesource</a> (here the latest versions of node.js can be installed), we look through here: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3ad/aa7/0c9/3adaa70c90a1466c1a55b71eb25f2105.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Copy and run the following commands in turn: <br><br><pre><code class="javascript hljs">curl -sL https:<span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">//deb.nodesource.com/setup_11.x | sudo -E bash - sudo apt-get install -y nodejs</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  Checking how the team installed <br><br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs">nodejs -v</code> </pre> <br>  Show us the version of node.js <br><br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs">npm -v</code> </pre> <br>  It will show us the version of the package manager for node.js. <br><br>  Next, go to the folder / opt / mysuperapp (my_super_app_name - this folder you must create).  The opt directory was chosen as the location of the application after long googling “where it’s appropriate to put the application's node.js files in ubuntu”. <br><br>  Finally, we create the server.js file, which will be the entry point of the application, and paste the code of the simple server on node.js there: <br><br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span></span> http = <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">require</span></span>(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'http'</span></span>); <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span></span> hostname = <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'localhost'</span></span>; <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span></span> port = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">80</span></span>; <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span></span> server = http.createServer(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-function">(</span><span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">req, res</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function">) =&gt;</span></span> { res.statusCode = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">200</span></span>; res.setHeader(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'Content-Type'</span></span>, <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'text/plain'</span></span>); res.end(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'Hello World!\n'</span></span>); }); server.listen(port, hostname, () =&gt; { <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">console</span></span>.log(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">`Server running at http://</span><span class="hljs-subst"><span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-subst">${hostname}</span></span></span><span class="hljs-string">:</span><span class="hljs-subst"><span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-subst">${port}</span></span></span><span class="hljs-string">/`</span></span>); });</code> </pre> <br>  Port 80 is for http requests, 443 is for https.  While we have a server on http. <br><br>  Save everything and run the command: <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">node server.js</code> </pre> <br>  The line 'Server running at <a href="http://localhost/">localhost</a> : 80 /' should appear in the console <br><br>  Now you can open the browser, enter the external IP (the one in your Yandex cloud with your ubuntu VM) and we will see “Hello World!” <br><br><h2>  We do everything conveniently or the development cycle with git </h2><br>  Everything seems to work, but we will not work all the time connecting to the cloud.  In addition, all of a sudden we will work in the future not alone. <br><br><h2>  Github </h2><br>  Github is the place where our application code will be located.  In short, the principle of work for one person is as follows: <br><br><ul><li>  On the home PC we develop our application. </li><li>  We save and unload the code on Github in one click. </li><li>  On a hosting or on another PC, download our application from github, reboot the server (if it is hosting) and the new version of our web application is available on the world wide web. </li></ul><br>  Everything is fast, simple and convenient. <br><br>  Actually register on Github and create a private repository for our application (it will be available only to us): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a10/e93/4b3/a10e934b3516444c1c8aad1b45035494.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Copy the line <a href="">github.com/ReTWi/mysuperapp.git</a> to download the application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/465/959/824/4659598241a27171fbbaa8e61c3a66c2.png" alt="image"><br><br><ol><li>  We return to the bitvise command line, stop the application by pressing ctrl + c (if it still works). </li><li>  Go to the directory / opt and delete the folder we created with the application </li></ol><br>  Git is what we will use to download our application on github, and from there to a hosting or other PC.  Git is a separate topic for discussion, so for now let's stop at this. <br>  Install <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-git-on-ubuntu-18-04-quickstart">git on hosting with</a> commands: <br><br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs">sudo apt update sudo apt install git</code> </pre> <br>  Check whether everything is well established: <br><br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs">git --version</code> </pre> <br>  The git version should appear. <br><br>  We fill in the git data (and did not understand why, but apparently there may be some boring warnings). <br><br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs">git config --global user.name <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"Your Name"</span></span> git config --global user.email <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"youremail@domain.com"</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  Finally, we upload our application to the hosting with the command: <br>  (there should be a link to your application) <br><br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs">git clone https:<span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">//github.com/ReTWi/mysuperapp.git</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  A new mysuperapp will appear in the / opt directory, where our application files downloaded from github will be located. <br><br>  Now it's time to repeat the same thing for the PC and close the PC chain (different) -&gt; Github -&gt; Hosting <br><br>  Install <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">node.js on the PC</a> . <br><br><h2>  Visual studio code </h2><br>  To begin, select the source code editor, where we will work.  I chose the Visual studio code, it is so simple, convenient, there are a lot of plug-ins in it and you can set up the synchronization of settings if you work from several devices.  Actually download, install, run, select a shared application folder, as git clone will create your own. <br><br>  The plugins I use are the following: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7e5/5c2/17f/7e55c217f685490573a70f44970e0780.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="https://git-scm.com/download">Install git for PC</a> . <br>  Open the console in VScode with ctrl + shift + `or terminal&gt; new terminal <br><br>  <i>Retreat:</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>In the windows console, it’s bad with Russian characters and so that there are no cracks you need to open file&gt; preferences&gt; settings, type in terminal.integrated.shellArgs.windows, click</i> <i><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a70/787/6a5/a707876a56e4c0a2b601358d4aa7caf1.png" alt="image"><br><br></i>  <i>And add the line "terminal.integrated.shellArgs.windows": ["-NoExit", "/ c", "chcp 65001"],</i> <i><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/57d/217/da6/57d217da62d4189b8640eb854f07a8a0.png" alt="image"></i> <br><br>  Repeat the command to download files from github: <br><br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs">git clone https:<span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">//github.com/ReTWi/mysuperapp.git</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  In VScode, click File&gt; Open Folder and open the folder of our application. <br><br>  Create a server.js file with the same simple server code: <br><br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span></span> http = <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">require</span></span>(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'http'</span></span>); <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span></span> hostname = <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'localhost'</span></span>; <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span></span> port = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">80</span></span>; <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span></span> server = http.createServer(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-function">(</span><span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">req, res</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function">) =&gt;</span></span> { res.statusCode = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">200</span></span>; res.setHeader(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'Content-Type'</span></span>, <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'text/plain'</span></span>); res.end(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'Hello World!\n'</span></span>); }); server.listen(port, hostname, () =&gt; { <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">console</span></span>.log(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">`Server running at http://</span><span class="hljs-subst"><span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-subst">${hostname}</span></span></span><span class="hljs-string">:</span><span class="hljs-subst"><span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-subst">${port}</span></span></span><span class="hljs-string">/`</span></span>); });</code> </pre> <br>  Install nodemon to automatically reboot the server when code changes: <br><br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs">npm i nodemon -g</code> </pre> <br>  i - short for install <br>  g - global installation (to be available in the console), and not just for our application. <br><br>  Run the command: <br><br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs">nodemon server.js</code> </pre> <br>  Open <a href="http://localhost/">localhost</a> : 80 / or just localhost: 80 in the browser and see Hello World. <br><br>  Now it's time to check our PC chain&gt; Github&gt; Hosting. <br><br>  Download the Github desktop for more convenience, connect your github account, then click the file add local repository and specify the directory of our application. <br><br>  In the application, we see the changes we made compared to the version loaded with Github (we added server.js): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/568/3d0/52b/5683d052b9fbba8fe609035fd8ba253f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Click “commit to master”&gt; “push origin”, thus uploading files from a PC to Github. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eeb/234/bf6/eeb234bf61a0ed5b2708b196e32da7d8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Go to our github account in the browser and see the uploaded server.js file: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1e6/cf8/e1b/1e6cf8e1b08c5a15d596193dd8b0efb3.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Let's practice a little more, in VScode we replace the string “res.end ('Hello World! \ N');” with “res.end ('OmNomNom');”.  We will see that the server itself has rebooted: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8c8/8cc/a53/8c88cca53e4d8d15632cc49e183817e7.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Check in the browser and see the OmNomNom changes we made. <br><br>  Desktop github will also show us that we changed the line: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/020/39b/7a0/02039b7a00fabe3c07037f6a356c1919.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Again, click “commit to master”&gt; “push origin” to send the files to github. <br><br>  Switch to hosting command line. <br><br>  Stop our application if it is still running (ctrl + c). <br><br>  Download our updated application with the commands: <br><br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs">git config credential.helper store git pull</code> </pre><br>  The first will save our data in order not to constantly enter a login and password.  In the future, git pull will suffice. <br><br>  Install pm2 - something like nodemon, only for hosting: <br><br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs">npm i pm2 -g</code> </pre> <br>  Let's start the application using pm2, which next time git pull on the hosting will restart our server: <br><br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs">pm2 start server.js --watch</code> </pre> <br>  Open the browser on our external IP cloud and see our “OmNomNom”. <br><br>  Thus, we have closed the chain of work with the application and its rapid deployment on the hosting. <br><br><h2>  Create temporary SSL certificates for HTTPS on localhost and hosting </h2><br>  Go to the site <a href="https://zerossl.com/free-ssl/">zerossl.com</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/151/be3/00c/151be300c4226e87b30b7f4735e09c83.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In the domains, ip ... field, first enter localhost, click generate and download 2 files by the button: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8a1/b4d/24a/8a1b4d24a65f44c3ba5a604a569e1811.png" alt="image"><br><br>  We keep them in our project in the ssl / localhost folder. <br><br>  Repeat the procedure for external IP Clouds and save to ssl / myapp. <br><br><h2>  We start more complicated https server node.js </h2><br>  Application structure: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/330/6da/e58/3306dae5836d651136b030b2cc64041e.png" alt="image"><br><br><ul><li>  client - our front-end will lie here.

On the other hand, express.js has been working for a long time and it will be easier for you to find information on it. <br><br>  React was chosen because it was easier for me to work, understand and try everything with my own hands.  Vue - already seemed something with its own rules, direction.  Although in Vue you may have to write something less with your own hands, but since the priority was placed on training, it went somehow easier for a person who had not previously programmed react. <br><br>  Save the package.json file and install all modules specified in dependencies with the command: <br><br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs">npm i</code> </pre> <br>  We will have a node_modules folder, in which there will be all modules for our application. <br><br>  client - while an empty folder <br>  logs - inside there is a .gitkeep file, so that the folder migrates to the hosting and the logs are successfully dropped there.  When developing we will display everything in the console. <br><br><h3>  public </h3><br>  Here the static files of our site will lie, the images there, favicons, etc. <br>  Separately dwell on two files: <br>  index.html: <br><br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;base href="/" /&gt; &lt;meta charset="UTF-8" /&gt; &lt;title&gt;MyApp&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;div id="cookies"&gt;Этот текст заменится содержимым react_bundle после его загрузки&lt;/div&gt; &lt;noscript &gt;Система: онлайн подключение возможно только при наличии Javscript&lt;/noscript &gt; &lt;script src="react_bundle.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;</code> </pre> <br>  - here we load the react-frontend and render it to the tag by its id. <br><br>  isProd.js contains a single line “module.exports = false” <br>  Since it is in exceptions .gitignore, it is not transferred.  Accordingly, on the PC we set it to false, and on the hosting to true.  Then we use this file to understand what kind of environment we are in now (development / production).  It seemed to me the most convenient, besides, you can partially change the code during development and test the operation of the modules in production. <br><br>  ssl - there are previously saved
