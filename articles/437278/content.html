Some not only speak, but do.  Among others - the company Boeing, which recently conducted successful tests of an autonomous passenger aircraft. <br><br>  This is <a href="https://boeing.mediaroom.com/2019-01-23-Boeing-Autonomous-Passenger-Air-Vehicle-Completes-First-Flight">reported</a> by the company itself in a press release.  The test flight was conducted in Manassas, Virginia, USA.  The aircraft made a controlled takeoff, freeze in the air and landing.  It does not work on gasoline, but on electricity, with a small cruising range of about 80 km, but this is enough for short flights in the city. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><div class="oembed"><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-0" style="position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg); max-width: 100%; width: 500px; min-width: 220px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" data-tweet-id="1088032429204369410"></twitter-widget><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br>  The wingspan of the apparatus is 8.53 meters. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/01/23/boeings-self-driving-air-taxi-completes-first-test-flight/%3Fnoredirect%3Don%26utm_term%3D.dc65dd334d6f">According to</a> the company, this was only the first step, during which a passenger aircraft was tested.
