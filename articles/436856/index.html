At the same time, she emphasizes that the scale of the influence of the information technology industry on the state significantly exceeds purely industry-wide effects, and the development of information technology is one of the most important factors contributing to solving the key tasks of the state policy of the Russian Federation: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúThe development of the industry is necessary for the transition to a new post-industrial technological structure, which is based on the widespread introduction of IT achievements in all sectors of the economy (convergence of these sectors with IT).  Communication and information retrieval using the Internet, remote (cloud) storage of information, as well as social networking have become an integral part of everyday life. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  In addition to the transition to a post-industrial technological order, the authors of the Strategy set the goal of ensuring the digital sovereignty of Russia in the face of hostile actions by the enemy: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúThe implementation of the Strategy will contribute to ensuring digital sovereignty, information security and a high level of the country's defense capability, including through the creation of domestic sanction-resistant products and modern means of responding and preventing global information threats, as well as by extending Russian security platform territories of friendly countries of Russia and increasing the degree of technological and educational integration with these countries ". </blockquote><br><h1>  State of the art </h1><br>  In Russia, there are just over 1 million software developers and analysts, specialists in databases and networks.  Their share in the total number of employees does not exceed 1.2%, the authors write in one place of the report, and in another place indicate that the number of employees in the Russian IT industry is 350 thousand people, that is, 0.5% of employees.  It is not entirely clear how these figures are consistent with each other.  Perhaps different parts of the Strategy were written by different authors. <br><br>  one. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/c1/jc/if/c1jcifsiybxgilh7cao_q0z4aoe.png"><br>  2 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9n/sk/cx/9nskcxqbcikpjgz40t7xrbel6q8.png"><br><br>  At the same time, for a number of countries in Europe with a developed digital economy, but not being the leaders of world software exports (Finland, Sweden, Germany, France, Japan, etc.), this figure reaches 2‚Äì3.4%.  "To achieve a leading position in the field of digitalization of the Russian economy, a significant increase in qualified IT personnel in the short term is required," concludes the ministry. <br><br>  In 2017, the growth of the IT market (at constant prices) was 12%.  The highest growth rates are shown by organizations involved in data processing, hosting and software development.  In the structure of the industry‚Äôs products, about 45% are software development and testing services, 25% are data processing and hosting services. <br><br><h1>  Export </h1><br>  At the end of 2017, the volume of exports of computer and information services exceeded $ 3.5 billion. The average annual growth rate of exports of products of the information technology industry over the past three years has been at 16%. <br><br>  Russia's share in the global export of IT-services is 0.8%. <br><br>  The Ministry of Communications and Mass Media notes the high positions of Russian system integrators who work in the global market.  The share of Russian companies in the global IT services market is about 1.5%, and domestic companies are more concentrated in the high-tech project development sector, occupying 8 positions in the rating of 100 leading service companies in the world. <br><br><h1>  Future plans </h1><br>  The Ministry of Communications and Mass Media has determined the main directions for the implementation of the Strategy, taking into account the problems that are now visible (staff shortage): <br><br><ul><li>  Mass retraining of specialists. </li><li>  Improvement of physical and mathematical education in schools. </li><li>  Modern professional training of informatics teachers. </li><li>  The increase in the number of students in specialized specialties. </li><li>  The development of engineering skills in business engineering and entrepreneurship skills among students, as well as in-depth study of basic end-to-end digital technologies. </li><li>  Stimulating the work of highly qualified industry professionals <br>  information technology in Russia. </li><li>  Popularization of IT as a field of activity. </li><li>  Improving institutional conditions. </li><li>  International cooperation and export support. </li><li>  R &amp; D, including: <br><ul><li>  photonics; </li><li>  new parallel computing algorithms; </li><li>  new biometric systems; </li><li>  development of interaction algorithms for robotic systems and humans; </li><li>  creating human-machine interfaces; </li><li>  introduction of new neurocognitive technologies; </li><li>  software for augmented (modified) reality </li></ul></li><li>  Priority areas of research: <br><ul><li>  cloudy, foggy and dewy calculations; </li><li>  blockchain in the storage system of medical cards, diplomas and workbooks of Russian citizens, in housing and utilities and construction; </li><li>  Internet of Things; </li><li>  machine learning algorithms; </li><li>  Big Data; </li><li>  Information technology, including the creation of a new generation of secure communication networks based on the quantum effects of encoding and transmission of information, the creation of stable and self-healing algorithms and methods; </li><li>  new development and testing tools; </li><li>  the creation of "digital twins" to replace the implementation of complex sets of human operations. </li></ul></li></ul><br>  The strategy also provides for the support of small business, that is, preferential loans and subsidies for Russian IT customers when purchasing domestic products and implementing projects to migrate their information systems from foreign to domestic solutions. <br><br><blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jy/sd/rr/jysdrr7tqgfjt50wtcshw89ctho.png" align="left"><h3>  Minute of care from UFO </h3><br>  This material could cause contradictory feelings, so before writing a comment, refresh something important in your memory: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How to write a comment and survive</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  Do not write abusive comments, do not go to the person. </li><li>  Refrain from using obscene language and toxic behavior (even in a veiled form). </li><li>  To report comments that violate the rules of the site, use the "Report" button (if available) or <a href="https://habr.com/feedback/%3Ftype%3D4">a feedback form</a> . </li></ul><br>  What to do if: <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/karma/">minus karma</a> |  <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/sandbox/">blocked account</a> <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/other/">Code of authors Habra</a> and <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/other/">habraetiket</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/rules/">Full site rules</a> </div></div></blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/436856/">https://habr.com/ru/post/436856/</a></p>
