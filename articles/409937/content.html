<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  January 29, 2018 a new Russian satellite was launched into the near-ground orbit.  The launch took place in St. Petersburg, in the area of ​​the Lakhta Center construction site. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gk/bq/k6/gkbqk6wjs5vfoo_pcmnpdhmro5s.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Start was successful.  From Monday, St. Petersburgers can observe a new celestial phenomenon: - the lights of the object's light marking almost a half-kilometer mark above the city.  Also, a good overview of the object is provided from the aircraft approaching the landing at Pulkovo airport. <br><br>  Of course, this is a joke.  In the photo - ground preparation for the installation of the constructive completion of the spire on the Lakhta Center tower.  The installation took place on the same day, January 29, 2018. The main European skyscraper reached the architectural height of 462 meters.  The last leg of the way up - the spire of the tower, 117.5 meters high - was done in five months.  How was the installation operation in conditions uniquely harsh for the global high-rise construction - read our review. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-f/3h/4q/-f3h4qo_2qacuroon4jyugxjmdw.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Lights of light marking on the spire of Lakhta Center.</i>  <i>January 29, 2018</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  January 29, 2018, construction site of Lakhta Center, an hour earlier: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/h7/on/ny/h7onnyy_avctee5a0anptver2us.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  A bit earlier: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0h/9y/a5/0h9ya50udbieeoew-3jwdjriv48.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Early in the morning of the same day: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vk/c1/zx/vkc1zxnqgshzhuo5wnqokkxe6w8.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/i9/n-/_d/i9n-_drmjcd0dnr9sixk8iucdyo.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  This lightning and bright finale is only the final part of the operation to install the construction of the spire of a skyscraper.

Exactly two years later - in September 2017 a unique operation began to install the Supertoll spire.  Climbing has accelerated twice.  The reason - in particular the design of the final part of the skyscraper. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pi/um/ud/piumudlhktl5a4ixsmd9la9sqri.png" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Metal carcass </h3><br>  The Lahta Center Spire is a pyramidal frame composed of several types of elements. <br>  The main supporting structures are columns-columns of meter-section pipes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0k/yb/ik/0kybiktcqsyjpg-zrg8u2mvb_u0.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Spire frame: column columns, Ø 1020 mm.</i>  <i>December, 2017</i> <br><br>  Every 8.4 m, the legs are fastened with horizontal and diagonal connections — also tubular, but of smaller diameter.  Horizontal elements are annular beams.  Diagonal - beam-braces. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kz/xw/iq/kzxwiq2g1yb724vtgq4cbq2y4ko.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Spire frame: ring beams and beam-braces.</i>  <i>December, 2017</i> <br><br>  Another type of elements of the spire is responsible for its architectural scope. <br>  The tower in the plan has a pentagonal shape, and in height there are “ribs” spiraling around the central axis. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/me/wb/db/mewbdb1zmugfelk6tu82gi14z0a.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Spinning tower shape.</i>  <i>The outer corners of the building are shaped by the “ribs” of the skyscraper.</i>  <i>January, 2018</i> <br><br>  In order for the spire to be an organic continuation of this complex volume, half-timbered beams were introduced into the framework, forming triangles in plan.  Such structures are placed on five sides and create the outer corners of the spire. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mn/bp/nb/mnbpnb2tuo2cohwr7erggaennti.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Half-timbered beams to form a spire.</i>  <i>December, 2017</i> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/s0/1u/4t/s01u4tzdhyoxcofk5gyooie0mjm.jpeg"></a> <br>  <i>Due to the half-timbered beams, the spire is an organic continuation of the tower.</i>  <i>December, 2017 (clickable)</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lr/9o/f7/lr9of7v1wqlxp_4tgnnp_zoprqk.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>The main elements of the pyramidal frame of the spire.</i>  <i>December, 2017</i> <br><br>  Above 420 meters, when the spire is narrowed as much as possible, instead of five perimeter columns, a central pillar appears - also of a tubular section, with a diameter of 1,420 mm.  The final 13 meters - the cone-shaped final design of the spire. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ez/fb/fq/ezfbfqagrpvubvjoycr06_stcr4.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>General scheme of spire constructive</i> <br><br><h3>  Non-freezing </h3><br>  On the half-timbered frame formed by force elements, the facing of the spire is fastened. <br>  It has an important feature: instead of glass, a stainless steel mesh is installed in the frames. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yl/gw/8z/ylgw8z-nkeqnpwjzmu7-kspa08i.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>Mesh samples for facing the spire facade.</i>  <i>Layout area.</i>  <i>June 2016</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bw/be/i_/bwbei_v9splbw8a0vvzpqjjw23q.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Grid in the front profile.</i>  <i>Spire Lakhta Center.</i>  <i>December, 2017</i> <br><br>  Replacing glass with a mesh is a must in St. Petersburg microclimate. <br>  Humidity and cold contribute to the formation of ice, and most of the spire passes through unheated space. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/en/72/rf/en72rftqh9r5boifccqptsgzhi0.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/e6/mt/1r/e6mt1rsuqezhww9w-eplhhbtfi0.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Unheated metal at height: icing of cranes.</i>  <i>January, 2018</i> <br><br>  The cellular structure of the surface prevents the snow from splitting into layers, and the ice into large icicles.  When gathering, for example, under gusts of wind, the snow breaks up into small fractions.  In other cases, the wire mesh becomes a kind of rebar, which is growing ice - reinforced by a metal rod, it is more resistant to spontaneous chipping. <br>  For example, a photo of a crane on which you can compare the formation of a snow layer on a solid and mesh surface: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cl/ij/kd/clijkdkfcmxf-sjbki3s9mh5xww.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Formation of snow cover on an unheated metal surface:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>1 - solid frozen surface with snow cover</i> <i><br></i>  <i>2 - surface with cellular structure, snow layer is not formed</i> <br><br>  The decision on the facing of the facade was done, of course, not while observing cranes - this is just an illustration.  Lakhta Center is the northernmost skyscraper in the world.  The matter is aggravated by a transitional climate to the sea, with humidity of 94% and active circulation of air masses with fast and frequent changes in the weather.  For the <abbr title="Anti-icing system">PIC</abbr> system, different options were considered, for example, coatings that prevent metal from adhering to ice.  According to the results of calculations and a series of field tests in Russia and Canada, they settled on the most effective option - a mesh lining.  And for special weather cases in part of the structures of the spire laid profile with a heating cable.  At achievement of certain indicators on ice formation, the <abbr title="Automatic Building Management System">CMS</abbr> includes a small heating, to prevent the formation of ice. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/va/mz/1v/vamz1ve-5e8f4aeoqnqd-0tpdpk.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>PIC tests for Lakhta Center</i> <br><br>  Heating elements will start after the completion of the skyscraper engineering systems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ew/f3/pd/ewf3pd3x8kw_hctn11h7ih_ptjs.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  How to combine types of facades </h3><br>  Will there be a difference between the glass and the grid in the facade of a skyscraper?  To pick up two different materials so that they look like the same - a challenge for designers.  The thickness, color, texture of steel wire for making the mesh was long and carefully selected. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mn/-x/45/mn-x45aexgtwib51wmnhllmk-r4.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Front elements of the spire.</i>  <i>December, 2017</i> <br><br>  On hand designers - height.  If at a distance of a meter the glass is distinguished from the grid by anyone, then for half a kilometer, given the careful selection of the texture of materials, this is unlikely. <br><br><h3>  Walk through the facade </h3><br>  Will there be precipitation inside the spire due to its mesh lining?  Insects?  Birds? <br>  The height of the mesh is small - just over 25 mm.  They did not diminish any more - this would increase the windshield of the spire.  Enlarge - also, otherwise the question of birds would become relevant.  The ubiquitous mosquitoes remain.  But above the 20th floor of the tower, their flights have not yet been observed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dj/je/r6/djjer68t6qzfjt7pzyfky_qzdf4.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Spike facade mesh</i> <br><br>  But the snow and rain in the sub-spill space will be able to fall.  But this is not a big problem.  Everything that will be located inside the spire is made of anti-corrosion materials that are resistant to different weather conditions.  A small accumulation of precipitation on the upper overlap is a permissible thing.  After all, no one seriously worried about the snow or puddles on the roof of the house?  The Petersburg TV Tower does not suffer from precipitation, does not close the pipes of plants in the snow or rain. <br><br>  *** <br><br><h3>  FOUR STEPS TO THE TOP </h3><br>  The installation of the spire was divided into four stages - in accordance with the features of its four constructive zones. <br><br><h3>  Step 1: Zone of Record </h3><br>  <i>September-October 2017</i> <br><br>  The first zone is transitional, conditionally “pre-sawn” space.  This is the habitable and heated part, from the 83rd floor to level 88 (elevation 378 meters). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qs/sk/z1/qsskz1dqozezw9pn6hwkht3sapu.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Level 88. Above - Spire Only</i> <br><br>  The five transitional floors of the tower are distinguished from the rest only by the fact that the bearing perimeter composite columns give way to steel columns-racks.  Otherwise, there are no differences: all the structural elements of other habitable zones of the skyscraper are present: the core, interfloor overlappings, the glass facade ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jo/k7/gh/jok7ghttb014d2veyxaeqxehj1e.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>At level 83, end of August 2017. The first section with steel pillars</i> <br><br>  Rack columns have a smaller diameter compared to composite.  In addition to the constructive ability to reduce the cross section, this has a plus operational property: improved visibility in the panoramic restaurant and on the Lakhta Center observation platform. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/au/io/bd/auiobdz3m3pidejcjbyxllexiei.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Panoramic restaurant on the 76th floor of the tower of Lakhta Center.</i>  <i>Visualization</i> <br><br>  The transitional space ends with an overlap at level 88.  Conventionally, the overlap on the 88th can be called the "roof" of the building.  At the stage of passing this level, Lakhta Center became Europe’s tallest skyscraper, overtaking the Federation Tower - before the installation of the half-timbered spire. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d5/06/59d5061af0d03203729615.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Step 2: Five Columns </h3><br>  <i>October-December 2017</i> <br><br>  The second stage - from 89 to 100 level (elevation 428 m).  Here we already see the half-timbered spire in its purest form.  From level 89, the number of columns is reduced from ten to five: this is enough to carry a lightweight frame and steel mesh cladding.  The spire weighs about 2,000 tons - an almost imperceptible amount of 670,000 tons of the total mass of the tower. <br><br>  In order for the columns to maintain the correct spatial position from the moment of their installation until the moment of fixing with ring beams and braces, the builders used temporary structures-struts.  The assembly of a framework is an algorithm of several successive operations: installation of columns - fixing with struts - installation of diagonal and ring beams - dismantling of temporary structures. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jv/dh/en/jvdhenpo9qar7t2dv-cfviss7g0.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  The facade is not fixed yet: below, at the 88th level, the interfloor concrete hardens.  But then the stairs and the system of suspended platforms along the perimeter of the future spire facade are mounted immediately.  In the life of the spire after construction, those who serve the structure and equipment located inside will move along these paths.  English-speaking contractors call such overhead “roads” “feline” - cat wau. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ms/rr/fr/msrrfrfmrxxg7lo4tkocnn8ievm.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Suspended platform in the spire of the tower.</i>  <i>January, 2018</i> <br><br><h3>  Step 3: The central axis, the earth - the sky </h3><br>  <i>December 2017- January 2018</i> <br><br>  Mark 420 meters - the last level of steel perimeter columns.  In this section, they pass the baton to the central pillar column. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3s/l7/yv/3sl7yvxtqbvrdlgyugbe1p-ha0u.gif" alt="image"><br>  <i>Lowering to the mounting level of the first segment of the central column.</i>  <i>December 2017</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ey/wa/g7/eywag7gu_gya_xzifygobgxmpc0.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>The transition from the perimeter columns to the central rack.</i>  <i>January, 2018</i> <br><br>  Constructive of the highest levels of the tower is collected on the ground.  These are spire blocks that start at the hundredth level.  On the ground, two annular beams are mounted with a front element between them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6g/ih/lk/6gihlkexwdo_cnsxsiwyahtvpwc.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Assembling the element of the spire on the ground.</i>  <i>January, 2018</i> <br><br>  Then the crane lifts the assembled element to a height, and installers install it on the central tube, like on the core of a pyramid. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mt/ck/t3/mtckt3vpfniw1o8rtzu66c95bkw.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Lifting precast unit</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bz/dy/fd/bzdyfduh5x7lxkmxhx05yqiba-w.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>General view of the spire on the eve of the final.</i>  <i>January, 2018</i> <i><br></i> <br><h3>  Step 4: Final! </h3><br>  <i>January 2018</i> <br><br>  January 28-29, 2018 - mark 449 m. Installation of the final design of the spire.  This is the most difficult part of the whole operation.  The maximum height, wind, features of constructive completion of the spire and extension of crane equipment - these are the factors that make this part of the process exceptional. <br><br>  How it happened - read in the second part of the review.  There you will find answers to the questions: what did the builders wait for a few days before the start of the operation?  Why did the crane specialists think that installing the final part of the spire by a crane was impossible?  Why not call the helicopters?  How did the builders' days go by at exorbitant levels?  And what is the most frequent answer to the question - what is most remembered at a construction site in Lahta? <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/https://translate" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  *** <br>  Read more about the spire <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/lakhtacenter/blog/297695/">here.</a> <br><br>  *** <br><br>  <i>Thank you for your help in preparing the material for the construction control engineer of the IFC customer service Lakhta Center Igor Romanenko, AECOM construction control engineer Alexander Pimakin, Renaissance Construction engineer Rustam Doschanov, Liebherr service engineer Sergey Prochuhan.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Photos of Vyacheslav Korolev (operation on installation of a spire, inside a spire), Alexey Svotin (photo from cranes), Ruslan Genk (photo from cranes), Nikolai Gontarya (summer), Ivan Smelov (summer), Igor Romanenko (clouds), Rustam Doschanov ( cranes, spire mounting operation), Alexander Pimakin (clouds over the city, sunset).</i> </div>
