Research (though not very successful, the translator's note) attracted funding from <a href="https://www.calicolabs.com/news/2018/01/25">Google</a> , and Unity Biotechnology, which develops drugs for the treatment of age-related diseases, also <a href="https://qz.com/878446/unity-biotechnology-cure-for-aging">raised a lot of money</a> .  Now the concept has attracted a new group: cryptocurrency magnates. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Millionaires whose fortune is associated with a cryptocurrency boom donate to research, which, according to <a href="http://www.sens.org/about/leadership/executive-team">Aubrey de Gray,</a> can extend human life for thousands of years.  Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin recently <a href="http://www.sens.org/outreach/press-releases/srf-receives-24m-ethereum-donation-from-vitalik-buterin">donated $ 2.4 million to the</a> nonprofit SENS Research Foundation to help develop anti-aging biotechnology.  SENS also <a href="http://www.sens.org/outreach/press-releases/srf-receives-additional-1m-donation-from-pineapple-fund">contributed $ 2 million to the</a> anonymous <a href="https://qz.com/1160997/a-bitcoin-millionaire-is-giving-away-a-fortune-to-psychedelic-research-curing-aging-and-clean-water">Pineapple Fund</a> . <br><br>  According to de Gray, who spoke in a <a href="https://www.acast.com/dannyinthevalley">podcast</a> with Sunday Times reporter Danny Fortson, it is not surprising that the cryptocurrency community has shown interest in this research.  The first participants are “usually people who are very interested in technological progress,” says 54-year-old De Gray, who previously worked in the field of artificial intelligence and received a Ph.D. from Cambridge.  Young people are more open to the idea that aging is an "important, solvable problem." <br><br>  For example, Buterin is 24 years old, and he has co-founded the <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">second most significant</a> cryptocurrency.  In a statement reporting his donation, Buterin welcomes the SENS program, “aimed at addressing the problem of aging, one of the biggest challenges facing humanity.” <br><br>  According to de Gray, the non-profit organization received approximately $ 6.5 million in Bitcoin and broadcast.  The fund immediately sells all cryptocurrency donations, usually for dollars, for it, as a non-profit organization, financial speculation is prohibited.  SENS has an annual budget of $ 4 million. <br><br>  According to de Gray, the goal is to develop technology fast enough to stay one step ahead of the challenges of aging, as he told the Sunday Times.  He believes that there is a 50% chance that SENS will prove the viability of its efforts with the use of laboratory mice in the next five years, and will start a “war on aging”. <br><br>  “It all depends on how soon we make the key breakthroughs,” he said, describing the “all or nothing” study.  In the future, he added, a person’s lifespan will be measured in either two digits or four digits. </div>
