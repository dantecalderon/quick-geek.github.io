<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, on duty, I had to get acquainted with several gadgets, each of which, one might say, with a twist.  We decided to collect all this in a very short selection. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ge/ho/a4/gehoa4wgxie_jwryulpkyislix4.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As a small introduction, I would like to note that there are quite a few unusual watches.  Some of them we have already given in the collections ( <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/262760/">wrist</a> , <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/262752/">table and wall</a> ).  Here we will list those that are already available or will be available soon. <br><br>  <b>Nixie clock</b> <br><br>  <i>Chip: the clock on the indicators</i> <br><br>  Strictly speaking, this watch model is extremely famous.  And, most likely, Geek times is much more interesting for the audience to collect such watches, rather than to buy them, especially since the prices for them (to put it mildly) are high - <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/lighthouse-in-14-silver.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dwatch%26utm_campaign%3Dnixie">16200 RRC</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/g4/wl/0p/g4wl0purmr3bww1nxhdwq3_ea_0.jpeg"><br><br>  Nevertheless, it should be noted that the popularity of ready-made models does not subside.  Even on Aliexpress, perhaps, that the assembled models are now typed more than consumables, and the cost can reach tens of thousands.  The model from Lighthouse is very compact: there are only four digits.  Of the controls and settings - a small panel on the back of the case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ss/1d/qf/ss1dqfjqadwckh7xyb5ktnmus8a.jpeg"><br>  <i>From left to right: backlight lever, connector for adapter, time and brightness settings buttons.</i> <br><br>  There are no additional functions for this watch. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/m5/om/sz/m5omszfcofe4pdzosdjnitkm0bq.jpeg"><br><br>  The clock supports 12-24 hour formats of time display, have backlight. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/f3/it/11/f3it11f1jjfwtd7xn0tthklkluu.jpeg"><br><br>  Probably, the supplier himself looks at this model for a business gift.  In any case, they are prestigiously packaged. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ge/-q/ed/ge-qedse1eiralovkohpjfe9zng.jpeg"><br><br>  Inside instruction in Russian. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Clock size</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gq/ft/-q/gqft-qm3deoynwxjrfi5gmqmhws.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xp/33/ej/xp33ej-7i82n2gfdbyxm2cy7vio.jpeg"><br></div></div><br>  <b>Specifications:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Voltage - 5V </li><li>  Power consumption - 1W </li><li>  Indicators - IN-14 </li><li>  Accuracy ± 1 second per day </li><li>  Working temperature +1 - +40 </li></ul><br>  For those who are just picking up a business gift: a 20% discount coupon is valid for this model until the end of March - <b>20LIGHT</b> . <br><br>  <b>Sensorwake</b> <br><br>  <i>Chip: alarm clock, which wake up not by sound, but by smells.</i> <br><br>  Strictly speaking, there is some slyness in it.  The official website states that before the device entered the market, tests were conducted, and people woke up from smells, of course, everything works. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d7/35/59d735f3b43d9879411720.jpeg"><br><br>  However, it is known that a person does not distinguish smells in a dream, in particular, a study was carried out to understand whether it is possible to remove sound from fire alarms, as a result of which it turned out that a person does not react to the smell. <br><br>  <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/olfactory-alarmclock.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dwatch%26utm_campaign%3Dsensorwake">Sensorwake</a> , however, is arranged slyly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d7/34/59d734c32673a477579233.jpeg"><br><br>  Here, at first, a soft sound signal is given, and only after some time, when a person begins to awaken, the aroma clock turns on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d7/31/59d731a1c00be124924135.jpeg"><br><br>  By the alarm clock will have to buy special cartridges that are installed on top.  Among the aromas there is the smell of bread, coffee, the smell of the sea, mint and some others.  The design does not have any smart features, it is not synchronized with the smartphone, and the settings are made on the case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d7/35/59d7356148885764243685.jpeg"><br><br>  The design is designed to make the process of awakening easier, more comfortable, without stress and negative emotions. <br><br>  A more detailed review of Sensorwake can be <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/293777/">seen here</a> . <br><br>  <b>Matrix PowerWatch</b> <br><br>  <i>Chip: watches that never need to be charged</i> <br><br>  <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/matrix-powerwatch.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dwatch%26utm_campaign%3Dpowerwatch">Matrix PowerWatch</a> - watches that have made a fair amount of noise due to the only feature - they never have to be charged, because they are charged from the heat of the human body. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pt/vi/gi/ptvigifyampemnypyweigthjmie.jpeg"><br><br>  Watches are positioned as smart, however, it would be more correct to say that we have a watch tracker in front of us: there are no smart functions in the first version of the watch.  They are controlled by physical buttons. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/p1/5q/1d/p15q1dqmcvwva1r7ksvmhbcp0ge.jpeg"><br><br>  The gadget stores activity statistics in the application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/58/dq/xb/58dqxbjdj4h-rh3jtvhmg-lltps.png"><br><br>  The first acquaintance is especially impressive when you start looking for something like a docking station or a charging cable with the old memory. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1d/tp/ph/1dtpphxb7178476mbiqjfautfls.jpeg"><br><br>  Another feature that the developers say is a more accurate calculation of calories expended on the basis of human energy. <br><br>  <b>Lametric time</b> <br><br>  <i>Chip: desktop smart watches</i> <br><br>  The <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/displej-lametric.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dwatch%26utm_campaign%3Dlametric">Lametric</a> digital display, like the Nixie model, is asked on the manager's table: flexible settings allow you to adapt the clock to your tasks and look, for example, at the site’s traffic in real time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5n/-9/xw/5n-9xwr7qsio_4ocbcbpfcjxmae.jpeg"><br><br>  Some of the settings can be done through a proprietary application, where dozens of both useful and, rather, amusing applications are available in the Lametric Store. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/if/q8/9g/ifq89g6mueaf2hvw2xcwcyomody.jpeg"><br><br>  Want to follow the activity?  - Synchronize the display with Fitbit, do you want to receive notifications about the change of subscribers on your social pages?  You are welcome! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0a/by/kv/0abykvdzaihk4t1nzd5qraek5vi.jpeg"><br><br>  Are you addicted to bid crypt?  This is also taken into account: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-l/es/jo/-lesjogb3jxtljbjuqniekshdxa.jpeg"><br><br>  Lametric is quite easy to manage gadget with intuitive applications.  The only drawback of the current version, perhaps, is the impossibility of battery life.  This can be felt when using the display as a Bluetooth speaker. <br><br>  Thanks for attention, <br>  have a good weekend! </div>
