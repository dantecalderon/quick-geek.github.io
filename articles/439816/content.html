Waited to do this course.  He doesn’t talk about how to get rich on bitcoins in two days and he doesn’t talk about how to raise millions in startup investments on paper with the help of ICO. <br><br>  This course is about a very specific practical application of blockchain technologies in business. <br><br>  We will tell about the principles of operation of this technology, about the areas where it can be applied, about the advantages and limitations. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Most importantly, we have collected and will tell you a lot of practical cases when this technology allows you to automate business processes, simplify and speed up financial calculations, deal with asymmetry and reliability of market information and much more. <br><br>  To hear cases from the first hand, we brought in experts from S7 TechLab (a division of the S7 Group) who, in their practice, paid for refueling the aircraft using digital smart contracts, developed a blockchain platform for automating trade operations, which, among other things, reduced settlement time with ticket sales agents from 14 days to 20 seconds and a number of other cases. <br><br>  Of course, we still tell about cryptocurrencies and ICO, but from a purely applied, process point of view.  Our task is for you to understand how it works, the financial application of this knowledge, we are sure you can find it yourself. <br><br>  In general, this course is for those who have long wanted to understand the blockchain technology and the possibilities of its application.  Come, it will be interesting. <br><br>  As usual, we made the presentation of the material as accessible as possible. <br><br>  The course starts on March 18th.
