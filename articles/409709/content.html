<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Sparking is the most common cause of fires.  Sparking can occur at the junction of the wires (stranding, loose contacts, mechanical damage to the wire) and is not noticeable until the heating of the wires leads to a fire. <br><br>  The USS-C1-40 device is able to detect arcing and turn off electricity.  In addition, the same device protects electrical devices from overvoltage in the network, which may occur, for example, due to a break or "burning out" of the neutral wire. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/11c/38a/a74/11c38aa7494e7a56892a04d0dad43ced.jpg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Included is a special sparking emulator plug for checking the operability of the device, instructions, a sticker with a status indication table. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a5a/940/f01/a5a940f01778425e9e69bc7943d5358c.jpg"></div><br>  The device is installed in the apartment panel after the introduction of the RCD or diphavtomat.  It is capable of switching current up to 40 amps. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/36d/4cb/ca0/36d4cbca0b43edfa9e5f837ba1ee52a2.jpg"></div><br>  The mechanical display shows the on (red) and off (green) devices.  Two-color LED indicates device status.  The regulator allows you to set the level of operation of overvoltage protection from 260 to 290 volts. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/891/bac/b2a/891bacb2a0bb9aebe6c7c5245d9168e3.jpg"></div><br>  To control the operation of the arcing protection, you can plug into any test socket protected by an AFDD, a test red plug.  The device will immediately turn off the electricity and its indicator will turn red. <br><br>  To test the protection against real sparking, I used an electric kettle and extension cord, which I wrote about a year ago (in this extension cord, the wire is simply bolted to the contacts and loose). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8ce/0f0/f2b/8ce0f0f2bd5eeb17aa6ef9032f14fe46.jpg"></div><br>  After a few seconds of arcing, the device worked and disconnected the load. <br><br>  To test overvoltage protection, I used a LATP and an accurate multimeter. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7db/70e/7d4/7db70e7d406b8c3d1fd0e40fe0552d27.jpg"></div><br>  At a voltage of 259 volts (when the threshold is set to 260 V), a shutdown occurred, and after turning off the indicator shows whether the voltage remains dangerously high (flashes red) or goes down (flashes green). <br><br>  The device itself consumes 0.33 W, that is, for a year it will spend only 2.89 kWh of electricity. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/73e/632/2ef/73e6322ef2f6433fae0493a80a4fe5d1.jpg"></div><br>  I made my experiments on video. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/66f5MSSGYN8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  As far as I know, a law has been passed in the USA obliging all homeowners to install such a device and after the adoption of this law, the number of fires has halved. <br><br>  UZIS-S1-40 costs 4,500 rubles.  Of course, this is not cheap, but the damage from a fire or equipment failure due to increased voltage in the network can be many times more, so I think that such a device, together with a RCD or a typewriter, should be installed in every apartment or private house. <br><br>  upd .: I wrote to the manufacturer and got an answer about the differences from the Meander UZDP: <br><br>  “Yes, of course, we know about this device and repeatedly tested its different versions.  (There were several of them). <br>  We made the entire set of test benches in accordance with the standard GOST IEC-62606-2016.  So Meandrovsky UZDP never worked in accordance with the standard.  In addition, in principle, it does not comply with the standard, as an example: the standard implies the existence of a free tripping mechanism, i.e.  mechanical disconnection, and there is only electrical, moreover, they have the ability to self-re-enable themselves in the algorithm, and the standard categorically prohibits it!  According to the standard, the device should operate from 2.5A, they have written in the passport that the device recognizes arcing from 5A, etc.  Read different forums, everywhere the same thing - constant false positives ...
