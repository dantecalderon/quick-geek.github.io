A podcast for tmlidov, development managers and their sympathizers.  This time we decided to talk about motivation, to draw a clear line between financial and non-financial, and also to determine which of them is more important for developers and how to develop them among employees.  Let's try to answer the questions: <br><br><ul><li>  when financial motivation works, and when not; </li><li>  when non-financial motivation to even start applying is useless in principle; </li><li>  how to motivate remote teams; </li><li>  and many others. </li></ul><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sk/as/9k/skas9kgkf1se12qqqznt-s4daxo.jpeg"></div><br>  <b>- Artem, hello!</b>  <b>What would you define motivation in general?</b> <br><br>  - Hello!  I am not very ready now for Wikipedia terms, but in general this is a popular concept from psychology, which has become part of mass culture and has given rise to a bunch of memoras on how to motivate office plankton so that they sit and work, rather than stare at Facebook.  Well, seriously, as for me, motivation is your inner desire to do something.  Go to work, help colleagues, help users of their product to solve problems.  And do it all well. <br><br>  <b>- And there is still such a thing as stimulation.</b>  <b>What is the difference between them?</b> <br><br>  - Yes, even in the very terms, look, stimulus is such a sharp thing on a stick, which chased donkeys and bulls to do what they need.  This is generally a story about a carrot in front (or even behind) that allows a person to work.  It is often used in masstaffing, that is, in relation to personnel from mass hiring, call centers, cleaners, taxi drivers and similar professions.  Roughly speaking, for people whose work is not related to creativity, who are doing something mechanical. <br><br>  <b>- It sounds cool, but not very clear - why is it?</b>  <b>Why bother with additional motivation, is one wage really not enough?</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  - If I understand correctly, your podcast is listened to by development managers.  So, a lot of people faced with a situation where the developer to criticize the code responds with something in the spirit: “What was in the TK, then I told you”.  And this is an example of an unmotivated employee who works for 2 sms per month - just for money.  Here the problem is for the organization, and for the team of such an employee, that time has already been spent on this work, and the price of such an error is maximum. <br><br>  And there is another type of employees who, having received the task, will first think 8 times, understand whether the proposal should be implemented exactly this way, they may have questions, they will come up and clarify.  And this is an example of a motivated employee, who cares about what he does.  He is not just a task maker, he is interested in doing everything well.  Here is the difference between motivated and unmotivated.  If you want to work with such, you need to engage in motivation.  Of course, if you are satisfied with what you write TK coolly and just as coolly they just do it without question, you can not engage in motivation and just pay people money. <br><br>  <b>- There are still salary increases, bonuses there, annual and quarterly.</b>  <b>If I raise an employee’s salary every six months, will it still be cool?</b> <br><br>  - You know, this is already a question of whether the organization has enough money to raise salaries every six months.  Because any repetitive action enters the norm, it is no longer perceived as something significant.  This is the first. <br><br>  Secondly, if we talk about people of creative work (and I refer to such developers as such), there is an interesting fact.  For 40 years, a so-called candlestick experiment has already been carried out.  People get into the room, in front of them put a candle, a lighter and a box with clips.  The task is to somehow attach the candle to the wall so that the wax from it does not drip onto the table.  People were divided into two groups.  First motivated financially, they say, if you do it quickly, you will get 20 bucks, and you will do it even faster - 40 bucks.  And the second said that the time for which they qualitatively solve this problem will be a benchmark for the rest. <br><br>  So here.  Those who were not motivated financially did this task 3.5 times faster than these guys with 20 bucks.  The experiment is conducted quite often and is constantly confirmed.  For people who are engaged in creative work, financial motivation reduces performance and productivity.  But people involved in mechanical work, from such a motivation to win and start working faster.  It was checked this way: all the clips were poured out of the box, which translated the entire task into the plane of mechanical work.  And people quickly solved it for money. <br><br>  Therefore, I think that if the increase in the level of wages changes something for creative professions, it will not work for the long term.  And any financial motivation tends to end.  If you raise a person every six months, he will think that he always received so much.  And that everyone in the market gets the same amount.  Moreover, he will always find in the market examples of positions or companies that will be willing to pay so much, and this will only strengthen him in such beliefs that this is the norm.  And he will want more. <br><br>  <b>- And how much time passes between the moment the salary is raised and when the employee starts thinking that this is in the order of things?</b> <br><br>  - Depends on the conditional threshold, which increases the salary, on how much it means for the employee.  In my experience - 3-4 months.  It is after this that a person changes his habitual model of consumption, he believes that he always received this new money.  I have never seen this work for more than a year.  No, if you pay a cleaner 500 thousand at once, it will work, of course.  Clearly longer will work. <br><br>  Here, we smoothly turn to the topic of financial motivation.  Is it just a salary or something other than bonuses? <br><br>  You know, it's probably just money.  I often argued on this subject and came to the conclusion that all these stories related to a comfortable office and buns are not financial motivation in themselves.  But money and bonuses are certainly motivating.  Short, but not bad.  But these conditions in the office, classroom parking, fruit there, are more likely not conditions of motivation, but ways to differentiate employers, this plays a role at the moment an employee chooses a future job.  But people rarely leave because they stopped bringing fruit.  They can hide behind it, yes, but the reason is usually different. <br><br>  <b>- In different companies, different awards, somewhere annual, somewhere quarterly.</b>  <b>What is the difference between them in terms of influence on a person?</b> <br><br>  - Here all the processes are individual.  Here is a performance review.  A number of companies believe that if a person performs well, then we will give him a bigger prize.  I noticed that the developers themselves do not think about the prize when they come to work.  They do not begin to write code with thoughts of the form: “Now I will write more code and the bonus will be more,” no.  They remember something about the prize for a month or two, because the review begins. <br><br>  I often see negative here.  Everyone is waiting for the premium, for them this is a kind of cutoff, will the person work in the company further, after the award, or not.  And from personal experience I will say that for developers, it’s not the amount of the bonus itself that is important, but feedback from the manager.  Premiums are usually tied to some rating system, and they are different.  Of course, the resulting estimate and feedback is more important than money only when the other minimums are met - market wages and so on.  And here is the situation that the money in terms of employee motivation fade into the background and do not have such a big value.  People do not work all year only in order to receive an award. <br><br>  <b>- OK, and periods — once a year, half a year, or more often?</b> <br><br>  - I worked in several models.  In the annual and semiannual cycles of performance review.  There is not much difference.  Personally, I was better in semi-annual.  If there are employees who simply stay up to the prize, then in this case you can shorten the dropout period for such toxic elements.  And if you do this once a year, then such employees can go into silent mode and sit silently, if only there was a bonus.  Therefore, every six months is better.  For the development team, the remuneration also depends on the daily performance review. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fb/8y/jv/fb8yjvk3tfwbca92sq4tfkp-yuc.jpeg"><br><br>  Studies show that it works negatively with developers.  If we talk about mechanical work, then yes, it is easier for them.  Well, like salespeople: working for a percentage is OK.  And for developers, the amount of code is not OK. <br><br>  It is not so much the frequency of the premiums that is important as the adequacy of the assessment of the developer’s work, its fairness and transparency of the assessment process.  So that it does not turn into a lottery - what prize will it receive there in a year and why. <br><br>  <b>- And if you completely reject premiums, how will this affect motivation?</b> <br><br>  - I will not specify the name, but there are a lot of companies where there are no awards in principle.  At the same time, they hunt people better on the market, because this premium is simply spread over current salaries.  Should I refuse the award and switch to such a model?  Not sure.  Now ask me now, am I ready to give up the semi-annual bonus?  No, not ready.  Sooner or later the prize will come.  I do not go to work just to get it.  But I am not ready to refuse it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hh/zo/3j/hhzo3jevpmessiwsrkxialjcp5w.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>- There is still such a thing as options.</b>  <b>Basically, in startups, but there are also in large companies - when the developer owns part of such a company.</b>  <b>Is this financial motivation or not?</b> <br><br>  - It is rather a mixture of financial and non-financial, in which there is even less financial.  The goal of a startup is to enter an IPO, and the possibility of obtaining options depends on it.  That is, when the company becomes public.  To achieve this, this is a non-financial goal of the employees, they can then enter a success story about their company’s IPO in a resume.  Conventionally, they know that after entering IPO there will be options and money, but in daily motivation this is precisely the low value.  But the goal itself - to go to the IPO - this is something for which you can go to work.  Becoming a public company is a motivation. <br><br>  <b>- It's funny, we are talking about financial motivation, and I just got a salary.</b>  <b>It seems to be motivated.</b>  <b>OK, you said that buns like dinners and other things don't work.</b>  <b>And if you buy a ticket for a conference, will it work?</b> <br><br>  - Of course.  Still looking how to present it.  If you tell the development team that he will go to konfu, if he passes the project on time, this is generally demotivation, rather.  And if you meet with him to talk and suddenly this one brought him a ticket, saying that he works cool and you decide to give him a ticket.  Here at this moment konfa becomes motivation.  When you thought about the employee and made him a surprise, there is faith in the manager. <br><br>  <b>- Got it.</b>  <b>That is, if we want to keep a person in the company, only this will not work with money, right?</b> <br><br>  - Let's face it.  Any developer is now looking for work 1 day.  That is, if he still selects an employer.  We did an experiment: one of our leads just opened his resume for viewing.  Within half an hour, they immediately received a call from 7 fairly well-known companies.  The market will always be the one who pays more.  But for a long time it is impossible to motivate only with money.  You’ll get a story like “You pay me, I work, I’ll pay less - I’ll leave.”  Developers have such strange looks. <br><br>  <b>- This does not mean that developers can be driven into the basement and not pay them?</b> <br><br>  - Well, there are startups that actually work almost in basements, they are OK.  Of course, developers have to pay, and conditions in the office should be normal.  If the developer has a normal office and market wages, he no longer thinks about non-financial motivation.  If you pay him so much that he still has to freelance after work or unload the cars there, then what kind of non-financial motivation is there, if a person has nothing to live on.  But if the base volume of consumption is closed, then the financial motivation itself is endless.  You can get 200,000, and you can 1,000,000. And you will always find an explanation why you should get even more. <br><br>  <b>- Come now about non-financial motivation more.</b> <br><br>  - This is what makes a person come to work every day, overcoming possible difficulties.  On the example of development, if it is an introvert, then it must daily overcome a certain barrier of communication.  Junior has to cultivate.  In order for a person to want to do this, it is important for him to understand what he is doing and why.  Here for developers it is already important to do something significant and breakthrough, and money is less important.  There is no silver bullet here, and building such a motivation is a long and painstaking work of you as a leader. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jt/hv/kx/jthvkxvg3ecixujju0z0rnl0dm4.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>- What does non-financial motivation consist of?</b>  <b>How to build it correctly?</b> <br><br>  - From the desire to come to work.  It is precisely not being built quickly, but gradually.  This is the moment of building a relationship both between the employee and the manager, and within the team.  If your team is constantly someone with someone swears and there is a hidden fight, there is nothing to talk about in terms of non-financial motivation. <br><br>  The employee here should see the leader of the leader, to whom you can come up with a problem and who will solve this problem.  Including not only working questions and problems, by the way.  A manager may be a friend of an employee, but it’s very important to keep a distance.  If the group constantly communicates with each other and with the leader only in ticket format, this is already sad. <br><br>  Attempts are still being made to motivate large groups at once.  Of course, for people with huge charisma like Musk or Branson, it works, but I'm here to motivate small groups.  I divide a large team into such groups and work with them.  The smaller the group, the easier it is to make a team of it and devote more time to each participant.  But if you have 15-20 people, this is already difficult. <br><br>  <b>- Can you single out three whales of non-financial motivation?</b> <br><br>  - I would sing it out in elephants to make 4. <br><br>  Firstly, face-to-face personal meetings are extremely important.  Secondly, technical improvement.  When a leader for an employee is a technical guru and mentor.  Thirdly, the employee must be aware of the importance of what he does every day.  That this is not just a set of tasks, but work for something more.  And fourthly, the informal part.  You should not treat an employee as a work force, you should be interested in his problems as well. <br><br>  These 4 things are very important for building normal relationships. <br><br>  <b>- Let's take a closer look at personal meetings.</b> <br><br>  - The modern head has not one and not two subordinates, there are several of them.  5, 15 or 25, for example.  You should know what they are doing, because they are judged by their actions as a leader.  Such meetings help build relationships with employees.  I’m not really in favor of being an employee as the best friend — there’s just enough “normal buddy” level.  On tete-a-tetah can be discussed and other problems of the employee, in addition to workers.  It is important to prepare for them and adequately carry them out.  I have often seen when such meetings are carried out purely technically: they hammer in a year in advance — every Monday at 8 am the employee arrives, talks about solved tickets (sometimes they even talk with ticket numbers, not tasks within tickets, this is very bad), the manager berates for something and people diverge.  Gradually they get used to such meetings and they cease to be important. <br><br>  The second side of the medal: sometimes the first couple of meetings are held as it should, and the third and beyond are just going to chat informally.  This is also not that.  Normal tete-a-tete is a mixture of working and non-working.  Especially cool if you prepare in advance and you know what problems an employee has.  Or just come to subordinates and find out how they are doing. <br><br>  If the employee himself wants, informal things can be discussed with him.  This sometimes has an awesome effect.  We had a case, the employee broke up with the girl, and this globally demotivated him.  I invited him to change the situation and roll up on a business trip to St. Petersburg.  He decided it was cool and drove off.  Rolled, aired his head, unloaded, returned and continued to work normally. <br><br>  Another thing is important.  If you promised something to an employee, do it.  Or come and tell, that did not rise.  But if you just say that you heard it, leave it, but you can’t do anything, then sooner or later the employee will stop sharing something with you. <br><br>  <b>- And what about Peter: will it not be possible that the staff will then invent stories to once again roll up to relax?</b> <br><br>  - With some employees this could certainly be.  But in my case, he simply described the problem, and not the solution - I already proposed a solution.  Of course, if he comes later and says: “Artem, I’ve got strained here, let me run to Peter?” - there is no longer here, this is not a good story.  You should include your head in everything, it should not turn into a system. <br><br>  <b>- Working and non-working moments - understandable.</b>  <b>And if a person does not want to talk about non-working, what to do here?</b> <br><br>  “Trust is not when you snap your fingers, and that’s it, you have trust.”  If the employee does not trust you, it is already a bell for you that something is wrong with you in communication with him.  Require nothing here is impossible, as well as crush.  Find out how his work is doing, in general, step by step, it will come.  You have an aim in itself not to learn something and pull ticks out of it, but simply to build communication.  You don't need to become a better friend either, just talk. <br><br>  <b>- And if the employee, on the contrary, began to open too much and consider you the best friend?</b> <br><br>  - You are the leader of the meeting, its moderator.  Control these things, stop them at the right moment.  If this happens, I try to have less informal communication.  Because in the long run it works sucks.  You can praise him for something as an employee, but for something and scold.  He can start working worse than everyone else in the team, knowing that you are not going to scold you: you are the best friends, what is there to scold?  Or even fire - friends do not.  So control the distance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/24/6c/ks/246cksqejr--deyqcrw-tkui-pk.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>- You talked about learning.</b>  <b>What does it include?</b> <br><br> — Совсем коротко: сотрудники разные и обучаются по-разному. У них есть софт-скиллы и хард-скиллы. Софт в современном мире это в том числе и коммуникации. Есть всякие курсы повышения ораторского мастерства и прочее. Есть курсы про архитектуру приложений. Любого сотрудника надо качать в обоих направлениях. Ты как руководитель сам должен интересоваться, что им интересно. Но не зацикливайся и не перегибай, если твой сотрудник интроверт, само собой, не надо его силком таскать на тренинги по выступлениям. <br><br> <b>— Ага. А как мне обосновать бизнесу, что мне нужны деньги на такие курсы для разрабов?</b> <br><br> — Чаще всего под обучение выделяют бюджет, и тут уже твоя прямая обязанность как руководителя его выбирать. В цифрах ты никогда не просчитаешь необходимость обучения. Или это будет финансовая модель, которую будет легко оспорить, или ее вообще невозможно будет сделать. Тут уже вопрос в доверии твоего руководителя к тебе — верит ли он, что ты все правильно делаешь, что сможешь построить мотивацию. В общем, просто приходишь и просишь денег на курсы. Или договариваешься бесплатно. Я вообще пару раз за свои водил. <br><br> <b>— Я правильно понимаю, что на цифрах такое обосновать очень сложно?</b> <br><br> — Абсолютно. Единственный способ, но далеко не верный, это говорить уже о цене потери такого сотрудника. Но это вообще на шантаж похоже, типа, или он идет на конфу или учиться, или вообще увольняется. Можно объяснять, что если не учить людей, это плохо скажется на остальном. Можно приземлять это на стоимость онбординга сотрудника. Тут уже цифры будут в твою пользу. Ведь всегда проще сохранить текущего сотрудника, чем найти нового. <br><br> <b>— А если человек обучится чему-то новому на этих курсах и захочет себе задачи уже из этой сферы, а не из привычной? Давать их?</b> <br><br> — Конечно. Я какое-то время думал, что ты просто приходишь такой к руководителю, спрашиваешь у него, чего делать, и он просто дает тебе задачи. В какой-то момент я пришел к нему и сказал, что задача мне не нравится. Мне с руководителем очень повезло, он сказал, ОК, дам тебе другую, то, что тебе интересно. Меня это тогда дико мотивировало. <br><br> Хочет человек освоить машинное обучение и потом брать такие задачи себе — пускай берет. Если это не входит в его обязанности, ты как руководитель подумай о том, чтобы его ротировать. Да, ты потеряешь сотрудника у себя в команде, но не в компании в целом. Зато он будет замотивирован. Дай ему развиваться, это в целом плюс для компании. <br><br> <b>— А если он каждую неделю хочет чего-то нового, быстро загорается и так же быстро потом тухнет?</b> <br><br> — Это называется “мигает”. Есть два типа людей в этом плане — склонные к такому и нет. <br><br> Со склонными надо выстраивать систему целеполагания. Когда говоришь с ним, ставь долгоиграющие цели. Уточняй, как продвигается их достижение, подогревай интерес к исполнению. Да, всегда будут люди, которые меняют точку зрения каждый день. Ты просто с такими работаешь или не работаешь. Потому что, как мне кажется, ты в 25 лет все же должен быть стабильным. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mk/ts/yz/mktsyzqvyilatgigu9tukzbtqby.png" width="540"><br><br> <b>— Давай про техническое совершенствование. Если архитектура классная, все сотрудники автоматом замотивированные?</b> <br><br> — Нет, это история не про текущую архитектуру проекта, а про то, как это будет развиваться. Ты можешь прийти в отличную компанию, где в бекенде огромный монолит, который уже сделан правильно. Но его нельзя менять. И ты просто работаешь без возможности опробовать новые технологии. Тут никакого самосовершенствования. Я даже термин такой слышал — “формошлепство”. Одно и то же каждый день делаешь. <br><br> Ну делает человек клиентское приложение или какие-то сервисы. Делает их хорошо. Но у него ничего не меняется, он ничего не изучает. Он просто быстро и хорошо делает сервисы.  It's all. <br><br> Это становится проблемой, история про то, что твой руководитель не разбирается в технической части того, что ты делаешь. Это тоже плохо сказывается, важно, чтобы руководитель понимал, что именно сотрудник делает. Я не верю, что сотрудник может быть замотивирован тем, кто не понимает, чем занимаются подчиненные. Для джуниоров особенно важно, чтобы ты был примером технического уровня, до которого им надо расти. <br><br> А если у тебя в подчинении есть человек, который сильнее тебя, надо тоже давать ему развиваться и не ограничивать его возможности. Тот факт, что ты даешь командам использовать новые технологии в продукте — это тоже про техническое совершенство. <br><br> <b>— Как глубоко ты разбираешь в том, что они делают? Ведь большинство руководителей в той же мобильной разработке приходят или с iOS, или с Android, и в какой-то момент у них появляются подчиненные с обеих платформ. Вот что тут делать — срочно изучать вторую платформу, которую знаешь не так хорошо?</b> <br><br> — Идеальной глубины нет, важно просто разбираться. В твоем примере, такой руководитель обычно начинает заниматься еще и Андроидом, но не стоит пытаться архитектуру андроидного приложения привести к архитектуре iOS, я такое часто видел, это негативно сказывается на работе. А когда ты стремишься понять, как ребята работают, как придумывают решения, это хорошо. Глубина сама по себе не так важна, тут стоит делать упор именно на архитектурную часть. <br><br> <b>— Ты говорил о разработчиках, которые сильнее тебя, что надо давать им расти. Будет ли это подрывать авторитет?</b> <br><br> — Нет, если ты построил правильные взаимоотношения. У руководителя ключевая роль. Я стараюсь набирать в команду людей сильнее меня, они позволяют придумывать новое. Иначе ты просто даешь указания, которые исполняют, и не развиваешься ни ты сам, ни твоя команда. <br><br> Ну и насчет авторитета. Важно, чтобы такого не происходило публично. Ты можешь заранее с таким разработчиком тет-а-тет обсудить, чего и как с конкретным решением. Но когда тебя принижают публично, ты перестаешь быть авторитетом для всех остальных. <br><br> <b>— Не боишься, что они будут приходить с решениям, которых ты не будешь понимать?</b> <br><br> — Вот тут есть две важные вещи. Если ты занимаешься техническим совершенствованием и проводишь встречи, то вероятность того, что ты чего-то не понимаешь, стремится к нулю. А еще не забывай проводить код-ревью и смотреть, как люди пишут код и как он работает. <br><br> <b>— Ты еще говорил, что сотрудникам важно осознавать, что именно они делают. Как этого добиться?</b> <br><br> — Да способов тут миллион. Давай я лучше скажу, как этого делать не надо. <br><br> Сильно демотивирует, когда ты перекладываешь ответственность за что-то на другого человека.  Here is an example. Приходишь ты к сотруднику и говоришь: “Саня, нам надо переехать на новый сервак сборки, готовься”. А он не хочет. И тут ты говоришь, что надо, потому что какой-то условный Ваня так сказал. Или ты просишь его сделать фичу, а он не хочет. Ты говоришь, что бизнес сказал сделать, значит, делаем. <br><br> И тут ты не то чтобы перестаешь быть для него авторитетом, но он понимает, что тебе самому качество выполнения этой задачи не столь важно, тебе важно, чтобы ее формально сделали, и все. Появляется формализм, который рушит всю мотивацию. <br><br> Это не значит, что ты должен его обманывать и продавать ему даже самую фиговую идею как конфетку, нет. Но если ты хочешь что-то сделать, ты должен в хорошем смысле продать это сотруднику. Объяснить, какие реальные плюсы это принесет. Главное, чтобы задача исходила от тебя. <br><br> Конечно, можно обсудить с командой ее целесообразность. Если кому-то не нравится, пускай скажут тебе, что именно не нравится. И тут можно или честно доказать, почему она крутая и ее надо делать, или отступить и сказать, что ОК, ее будет делать кто-то другой. Или вообще не будут делать. <br><br> <b>— Хорошо, мы обсудили, как построить мотивацию, теперь важный вопрос. Как все не испортить?</b> <br><br> — Главное — делать это постоянно и не забивать на это. Не думать, что тут есть какие-то мелочи. У меня вот был случай, сотрудник уволился через 3 месяца после того, как я его назвал неправильно, имя перепутал. Я тогда еще пришел недавно в новый коллектив, но вот такая мелочь типа “Ваня, извини, я назвал тебя Саней” настолько запала в душу, что он уволился. Мой косяк тут в том, что я этого вовремя не заметил и должным образом не общался с ним потом, что привело к его полной демотивации и увольнению. <br><br> Мелочей тут нет, надо всегда нормально готовиться ко встречам. Важно, как именно ты ставишь задачи сотрудникам, у тебя не должно быть слишком много прямых подчиненных. Тет-а-теты не должны становиться рутиной, у людей должны быть нормальные задачи и нормальные деньги. Если ты на все это забьешь, факап неминуем. <br><br> <b>— Когда лучше начинать саму практику нефинансовой мотивации?</b> <br><br> — Если ты ранее как руководитель вообще этого не делал, а тут резко побежал собирать встречи и со всеми такой разговаривать, наверное, это будет выглядеть странно. Здесь важна плавность решения, постепенно все это начинать. Я выбирал момент изменения заработной платы, и после этого начинал выстраивать отношения. Сам по себе момент поднятия зарплаты немного увеличивает мотивацию, и тебе как руководителю уже проще начинать мотивировать нефинансово. <br><br> Это может быть своеобразным триггером, мол, поднимаю зарплату и начинаю выстраивать взаимоотношения. Тут кому что, но я выбрал именно такой способ. Сначала финансово, а потом так, если вдруг я профакапил это на момент самого приема сотрудника в команду. <br><br> <b>— Нас тут в чатике спрашивали, как мотивировать удаленщиков.</b> <br><br> — Принципиально разницы тут нет, кроме расстояния. Немного сложнее это делать, да, личный контакт упрощает вопросы мотивации. Тут же вы находитесь далеко и видитесь по скайпу. В таких случаях я бы советовал иногда приезжать к таким командам и общаться с ними лично. Но тут важно делать так, чтобы эти приезды не были отчетными концертами, чтобы траву перед тобой не красили и прочее. Все должно быть прозрачно, предупреждай заранее о своем приезде, не лезь в чужой монастырь со своим уставом. А то приедешь такой и начнешь: “С фига ли вы в 10 на работу приходите, а не в 9?”, а они всегда в 10 приходят, вот так у них тут. Просто веди себя с ними так же, как и со своими ребятами в офисе. Это такие же люди и сотрудники. <br><br> <b>— Кажется, такая мотивация сильно завязана на отношения между руководителем и сотрудником. Если руководитель уходит, не получается ли, что вся команда так демотивирована, что уходит за ним или просто разваливается?</b> <br><br> — А это к тому, что не стоит мотивировать очень большие коллективы, а только группы на 3-5 человек, при условии вложенности. Тогда уход руководителя не прикончит организацию, группы останутся. <br><br> Конечно, когда уходит лидер, это максимально неприятно. Я не видел компаний, где лидер уходил, а все такие: “Ну давай, покеда, все круто тут”. Это огромная демотивация, и важно, кто потом займет его место, что скажет, когда придет. Будет ли пытаться разобраться в том, как все устроено. От этого во многом зависит тот факт, продолжит ли все разваливаться или нет. <br><br> Если вот эти тройки и пятерки сотрудников вокруг лидера выстроены нормально, все не рухнет, как карточный домик. А вот если у тебя 15 человек, для которых лидер — ты, а не их техлиды, вот тут при твоем уходе будет хаос. Кто-то будет уходить за тобой, кто-то на рынок. Но организация рушится. А группы позволяют сохранять целостность. <br><br> <b>— ОК, вот у тебя есть 5 человек, отличные лиды по направлениям, с ними все хорошо. Как сделать так, чтобы после твоего ухода не ушли и они?</b> <br><br> — Был такой опыт. Причины ухода бывают разными, но ты должен оставаться честным перед коллегами. Например, ты знаешь, что компания закрывается, платить больше никому не будут, и ты просто тихо сваливаешь — это плохой момент. А если ты честно говоришь, что поругался с большим шефом и теперь сам уходишь, то это воспринимается совсем по-другому. Потому что это твоя проблема с твоим руководителем, а не проблема команды. <br><br> Еще важно, как именно уходит руководитель. Я встречал компании, где руководитель при уходе перетаскивал за собой команду. Сам к этому отношусь строго негативно, меняя место работы, я не увел за собой никого. Мне кажется это кармически неправильным. <br><br> <b>— Давай я краткий итог подведу. Финансовая мотивация — это хорошо, людям надо нормально платить, офисы нужны комфортные, но этого недостаточно. Повышение зарплаты работает, но на маленький промежуток времени, после премии народ увольняется.</b> <br><br> — Нефинансовая мотивация — это тет-а-теты, обсуждение проблем, личных и рабочих. Обучение сотрудников, прокачивание их слабых сторон. Техническое совершенствование — тимлид должен понимать, что делают подчиненные. Самое важное: руководитель должен доносить до всех ценность того, что они делают. <br><br>  Exactly. Еще важно помнить, что история про нефинансовую мотивацию растет вместе с коллективом и не строится сразу, нельзя надеяться, что она построится очень быстро. Надо следить за этим, и тогда у вас будет классная команда, с которой вы свернете горы. <br><br> —————————————————————— <br><br> Аудиоверсию подкаста вы можете послушать вот <a href="https://soundcloud.com/devleads/devleads-2-nefinansovaya-motivatsiya">здесь</a> .
