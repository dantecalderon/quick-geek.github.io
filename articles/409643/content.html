<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There are so many different kinds of smart gadgets that it became difficult to navigate in this diversity.  However, there are gadgets that stand out from the crowd.  One such device is the LaMetric Time smart watch.  They are equipped with a screen on which you can display a lot of various information - not only time.  We can say that LaMetric Time is a hybrid device that combines the functionality of online radio, Bluetooth speakers, an indicator of social networks and other sites. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bx/3e/pu/bx3epu2_ccwx0bgqi6ug06hg3mq.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  First impressions </h3><br>  When you take the watch in hand, there is no feeling that this is a gadget with a screen.  The fact that the front panel of the device is covered with plastic, and rubberized.  As soon as the clock turns on, it immediately becomes clear that this is not a “brick” at all, but an interesting gadget. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f8b/0bc/1f3/f8b0bc1f307bc7973fe71c9f784be9e4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  By the way, it was created for geeks, as evidenced by at least the pixel graphics of the device.  The image on the display is formed using LEDs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fr/mn/bh/frmnbhr8ieiul2nucxjtuf2gyz0.jpeg"><br><br>  Otherwise, everything is simple, the design does not stand out with something special.  The clock is made in the elongated rectangle form factor.  In the lower part there is a rubber insert so that the device does not roll on the table.  By the way, the system is equipped with a light sensor, so that the image changes brightness depending on the degree of illumination of the room.  There are a few more physical buttons that adjust the volume.  The power button is located on the right side.  On both sides of the "bar" - the speakers, providing a normal sound. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/br/ac/hb/brachbqxcv2s_jybcjsisinvq84.jpeg"><br><br>  There are some more buttons which are located on top.  These are navigation keys, with their help you can switch between applications and select the one you need.  Behind the device is a microUSB port, as well as a headphone jack, you can connect external speakers through it (we don’t recommend connecting headphones, the quality will be far from ideal). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mr/kk/7p/mrkk7pm2tefqipbb40nyx91f2e8.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  How to setup? </h3><br>  In order to configure the device, you do not need to do anything complicated.  The LaMetric application is installed on the smartphone with the Android or iOS operating system and is controlled with its help.  In addition, you can connect to the device via Wi-Fi.  Once the network connection is complete, the clock can be controlled.  Here one note - the smartphone and the device must work within the same wireless network.  If you wish, you can add new Wi-Fi networks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mq/kv/tk/mqkvtkfvqs40tm7r0b5bv8gl4cy.jpeg"><br><br>  Applications for watches can be removed and added, they abound in the directory. <br><br>  Immediately after setting up LaMetric Time shows the time.  But if you do not look for easy ways, then you can choose something else.  Without customization, the system shows the weather, it has a timer, stopwatch, alarm clock, as well as a program to listen to online radio. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/r6/zb/0n/r6zb0narsi--urgcdbs9pdxkxa0.jpeg"><br><br>  For the convenience of the user, an application catalog has been created from which you can download new programs, if necessary.  This may be, for example, a program for displaying the number of subscribers on Twitter and Facebook, or maybe the statistics of attendance of your site, the news line and much more. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/03d/a38/eab/03da38eab244f2001d0480c42db936eb.jpg"></div><br>  If you wish, you can create your own application for smart watches by any developer.  By the way, there is already an app to demonstrate the course of the cue ball, so who needs to follow the rates of cryptocurrency this watch can be useful. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9e7/720/29d/9e772029d0009925e87609cf5cb27d7d.jpg" width="450"></div><br>  Bitcoin is not needed - you can choose a different cryptocurrency or fiat currency (dollars, euros, etc.). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6fa/ccc/dbe/6facccdbe45fd43ddde184d152012ecd.png"><br><br>  Smart watches would not be smart if they did not know how to work with the popular automation service IFTTT.  It allows you to significantly expand the already pretty good functionality of the device, adding the ability to work with gadgets that can not be connected directly to the clock.  Well, for example, with the help of a clock and IFTTT you can control thermostats (Nest and others), receive alerts from a computer, perform other tasks.  We need to meet with someone and this can not be forgotten - it's time to display the task on the screen of the clock. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lw/am/e_/lwame_djuidb5t3vbg7vlgeodak.jpeg"><br><br>  In addition to the image, smart watches can play music, as mentioned above, for example, stream music from the network.  For lovers of Internet radio there is an opportunity to choose radio stations, if you wish, you can add your own.  The volume and sound quality are not bad.  This is not hi-fi, of course, but the device is not positioned as an audio system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/w9/9s/qs/w99sqszyx2h3obad7_a9nfdf9x8.jpeg"><br><br>  You can work with this device at home or in the office.  There are quite a few scenarios for using the gadget, and among them there are both entertaining and purely business ones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mb/9w/ep/mb9wepoha_qe_qpdrrv59vgd2ro.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ji/kd/yz/jikdyzejtbcecmphs5dp1gtbifo.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Specifications</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Display: LED </li><li>  Sound: Stereo </li><li>  Power supply: from USB </li><li>  Inputs: line (mini jack), micro USB </li><li>  Connection: Bluetooth, Wi-Fi </li><li>  Dimensions: 36 x 61 x 210 mm </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/at/vd/4b/atvd4b2qqb_vkrngn3qoolgpj5m.jpeg"><br><br>  The Lviv company Smart Atoms has developed this system, which is now successfully promoting its products around the world.  For example, at CES 2018, the company introduced a new LaMetric Air - a universal device that can monitor air quality, measure temperature, humidity, noise and light levels.  All data is transmitted to the user on the smartphone in real time.  If conditions are too different from optimal, the user receives a notification.  The new version, by the way, has a touchscreen, and not just a LED display. <br><br>  As an output, it can be said that <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/umnyy-displey-lametric-time/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26amp%3Butm_medium%3Dpr%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3DLaMetric">LaMetric Time</a> is a device capable of performing many useful functions for the user.  There are not so many applications yet, but the catalog is constantly updated with new products.  The gadget can serve as a stylish addition to the interior, and as a practical system.  Due to the fact that LaMetric Time has the ability to manage a variety of devices and services, it is optimally used for this purpose at home or in the office. <br><br>  However, it has a minus, and a serious one - the lack of a battery and the ability to work only from the network.  Produce extra wires and buy this device for 14,990 p., Or do without an expensive toy - the choice is yours. <br><br><hr><br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26amp%3Butm_medium%3Dpr%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3DLaMetric"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d29/4c3/07d/d294c307dde04335ac3f425e73b36a7a.gif"></a> <br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/about/mails/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26amp%3Butm_medium%3Dpr%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3DLaMetric"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7fa/417/fe3/7fa417fe3d464fa5aa186b1ab30da53a.gif"></a> </div>
