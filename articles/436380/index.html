  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A quick start in 3D printing: budget printers for beginners or technology to the masses</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The moment came that having a small desktop 3D printer at home is not at all expensive, and using it does not require deep knowledge of technology or printing experience.  The store has some good models for less than $ 200 (!), Which will suit novice users.  All 3D printers can print popular and safe PLA plastic, which is odorless and is the easiest to learn. <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zv/jv/nv/zvjvnvgna3n-18xrbrzkdibkq-8.jpeg"></div><a name="habracut"></a>  Many have already used the services of 3D printing, or at least have heard about additive technologies. <br><br>  Every year this technology becomes more accessible, and Gearbest also contributes to this, making personal 3D printers even more accessible: cheaper and with delivery from availability in the Russian Federation (!). <br><br>  I'll start with a good 3D printer - <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/3d-printers-3d-printer-kits/pp_009693028451.html%3Flkid%3D19090481">E180 from Geeetech</a> .  The current cost is $ 219. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/b9/nd/xqb9ndip1ngxpjglxrue29peok0.jpeg"><br><br>  This copy is designed with the help of crowdfunding funds and was a success in 2018.  3D printer is equipped with a large touch screen, Wi-Fi module with access from a smartphone and a special application, as well as a microSD card reader with offline printing.  To work and control with E180 does not require a computer - just a smartphone or tablet.  There is a pause of printing with the preservation of intermediate results.  You can change the filament or turn off / on the printer.  In the event of a power failure, it is possible to continue from the point where it stopped. <br><br>  The printer prints 0.4 mm Geeetech special nozzles.  The working print area is 130x130x130 mm.  Positioning accuracy up to 25 microns, minimum print layer: 50 microns.  Compact strict design allows you to use it at work or in the office.  No sticking wires or exposed hot components! <br><br>  The next contender for the budget - <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/3d-printers-3d-printer-kits/pp_009478166183.html%3Flkid%3D19090481">3D printer IUM1 Portable</a> with a print area of ‚Äã‚Äã110 x 110 x 120 mm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rp/qo/qf/rpqoqfzqnwtvdgzrpzgezfry338.jpeg"><br><br>  The current cost is $ 189.  The printer has a compact design with a closed design.  All moving parts are inside the case.  The table is equipped with a special removable polymer plate to increase the adhesion of parts, the plate itself on a magnetic base for quick removal after printing.  The printer has a microSD card reader for printing without a computer, as well as a function to pause printing (pause) for filament change.  You can print color parts in layers.  Nozzle 0.4 mm, minimum print layer 100 microns.  The printer is compact, lightweight, closed - suitable for home use, in school or office. <br><br>  Another interesting and inexpensive option is a <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/3d-printers-3d-printer-kits/pp_942543.html%3Flkid%3D19090481">3D NANO printer from Easythreed</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ns/yf/hg/nsyfhg5lrzjqwmqcde5vbrw9fvk.jpeg"><br><br>  The current price is $ 159.99 with coupon <i>GBACERU0117C</i> .  This printer is a ‚Äúcube‚Äù with closed kinematics.  The table is completely immobile, the print head ‚Äúflies‚Äù over the model, which has a positive effect on print quality.  The nozzle is set 0.4 mm, the minimum layer 0.1 mm.  Because of the interesting design, the print area is divided into 2 parts.  The main one is 110x110x90 mm. <br><br>  Pay attention to his <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/3d-printers-3d-printer-kits/pp_009389661246.html%3Flkid%3D19090481">‚Äúbig brother‚Äù - EasyThreed ET4000</a> .  This printer is a larger cube. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1p/0e/5h/1p0e5huesipofwc-ebxa5wxiek0.jpeg"><br><br>  The current cost of $ 237.99 is already slightly more expensive, but in the pros there is a greater kinematic rigidity due to the increased number of guides, as well as the presence of a large touch screen for control.  The size of the print area 120x120x120 mm.  Printing accuracy is increased, the available layer size starts at 50 microns.  Nozzle too, 0.4 mm.  The manufacturer provides protective glazing windows, which is very useful if the printer is available to children. <br><br>  If you have the time and desire, you can build a 3D printer from the "designer".  One of the most popular kits for assembly is the <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/3d-printers-3d-printer-kits/pp_009633114070.html%3Flkid%3D19090481">Alfawise EX8 3D Printer Kit</a> .  The current day is the most budget option for home 3D printing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vg/jm/bb/vgjmbbjxzrk2o898y15t-qyceuk.jpeg"><br><br>  The current cost of $ 145.99, including delivery to the door, is actually at the price of components.  Alfawise EX8 is made with the latest improvements for printers of similar design.  Two drives installed along the Z axis. Improved airflow model.  The X carriage is reinforced. The Alfawise EX8 is equipped with a direct feed extruder drive that allows you to feed any plastic to the printer: PLA, ABS, PETG, SBS, Flex, and so on ... The large graphic display makes it easy to control the printer; SD card reader allows you to print offline.  There is a heated table.  The printer has the largest print area of ‚Äã‚Äãall indicated: 220 x 220 x 240 mm.  Minimum print layer: 100 microns.  The nozzle is set 0.4 mm, but it is possible to install any nozzle under the hot end MK8. <br><br>  For comparison, I add a fairly expensive <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/3d-printers-3d-printer-kits/pp_009436719692.html%3Flkid%3D19090481">branded printer: Tronxy C5</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fp/v_/r2/fpv_r2ojmp7nzfrsnqelwbj8kf8.jpeg"><br><br>  This is a printer-cube with an aluminum case, in a strict black design.  The current cost is $ 330.99.  The printer also has a direct feed (MK8) and a print area size of 210 x 210 x 210 mm.  Available materials: ABS, HIPS, Nylon, PLA, PVC, Wood.  Accuracy of positioning is 12 microns, the minimum layer is 50 microns.  Nozzle 0.4 mm.  Airflow is provided for the model.  Hard metal case ensures accurate printing and reduced parasitic vibrations during operation. <br><br>  Update: <br>  At the request of the comments, add <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/3d-printers-3d-printer-kits/pp_1845899.html%3Flkid%3D19090481">Creality3D Ender-3 DIY 3D Printer</a> <br>  Inexpensive pre-assembled printer for $ 199.99, the final assembly takes about half an hour - installing the portal to the base, plus connecting the electronics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gv/nv/cm/gvnvcmez3gqosqt3ohpmcm3yapi.jpeg"><br><br>  And the simplest printer for a nominal fee. <br>  <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/3d-printers-3d-printer-kits/pp_494194.html%3Flkid%3D19090481">Tronxy X1 Desktop 3D Printer</a> , which can be borrowed for $ 104.99 with a coupon GBTX123 (limited number). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xx/tb/q4/xxtbq47wo69facbex9x4k8eldai.jpeg"><br><br>  In any case, all listed printers will be convenient for novice users.  For slicing, programs like Cura, Slic3r, IdeaMaker and so on are used.  For EasyThreed printers, the E3D DORA brand slicer.  All printers use PLA 1.75 mm plastic.  The latter two may additionally use other specified types. <br><br>  If you have the desire and ability to print, you can look at interesting models in the public domain, for example, at <a href="http://thingiverse.com/">thingiverse.com</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/436380/">https://habr.com/ru/post/436380/</a></p>
