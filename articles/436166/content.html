I want to tell about my own achievements in terms of testing the strength of protected and not-so-many systems.  In addition, the Pwn2Own cyber security competition is usually held as part of the conference. <br><br>  This contest is often <a href="https://habr.com/ru/search/%3Ftarget_type%3Dposts%26q%3DPwn2Own%26order_by%3Ddate">written on Habré</a> , indicating the achievements of the winners.  This year, the winner can go home not on foot, but go on a brand new Tesla Model 3. Tesla <a href="https://electrek.co/2019/01/14/tesla-model-3-giveaway-hacker/">offers</a> its electric car to those who can crack the vehicle protection system. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  During the event, Tesla joined forces with Trend Micro, one of the organizers of Pwn2Own.  Thanks to the participation of Tesla, the competition received a new section “automotive”.  Cybersecurity experts will test the strength of the Tesla Model 3 electric vehicle, and if everything works out, someone will go home in the vehicle of the future. <br><br>  The total prize pool of Pwn2Own in cash and prizes is $ 1 million. In addition to Tesla, Microsoft and VMWare are sponsors.  But most of all attention, of course, attracts the opportunity to get an electric car. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e6c/e14/1c9/e6ce141c9034ad25d3a94a9eb9931301.png"><br><br>  By the way, Tesla Inc launched a bounty program in 2014.  In 2018, the remuneration rate was increased from $ 10,000 to $ 15,000.  In addition, representatives of Tesla said that electric vehicles that are tested for strength, do not lose their warranty. <br><br>  “We develop our electric cars, constantly remembering safety in all its manifestations, which is why we consider the help of information security specialists invaluable,” said Company Vice President David Lau. <br><br>  Prizes will be paid for compromising various auto systems, including modem, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, autopilot, gateway, as well as VCSEC systems.  You can also receive a reward if the key fob of the electric vehicle and the phone-as-key protocols are successfully hacked (if hacking allows you to take control of any of the car systems). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0fa/831/c8a/0fa831c8ac9f880791c807be9ccc5f93.png"><br><br>  Those hackers who achieve saving their privileges after a reboot will be given bonuses in the amount of $ 50,000 and $ 100,000. </div>
