Recently, we have been talking so little about <a href="https://realsense.intel.com/stereo/">Intel RealSense</a> technology that, perhaps, it is worth taking advantage of the occasion and talking about new products in more detail - especially since there are also good news on software. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Intel RealSense is a software-hardware technology for obtaining and processing three-dimensional images, that is, images in which the flat RGB component is supplemented by a depth map — the distance from each point of the photo to the camera.  To use this technology requires: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>RealSense camera</b> .  During the existence of their technology, several of the currently relevant models were released: the previous generation - the <a href="https://ark.intel.com/products/92329/Intel-RealSense-Camera-SR300">SR300</a> and the current one - just presented by the D400; </li><li>  <b>Intel RealSense SDK</b> software, drivers, and libraries.  <a href="https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/releases">The SDK</a> supports Linux, Windows and MacOS platforms and is now an open source product (which is good news);  Binaries and source code are published on GitHub. </li></ul><br>  New 3D-cameras are based on the latest RealSense processor model - D4.  For mobile devices, a smaller embedded version of the processor is available - D4m with slightly reduced features and integration via the MIPI interface.  By the way, Intel is ready to provide developers and manufacturers not only “boxed” RealSense solutions, but also components: D4 / D4m processors or D400 depth modules. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gj/jz/hb/gjjzhbjk_-bj8zfffhylbw1fqdo.png"><br>  <i>Depth Embedded Module D400</i> <br><br>  In the previous series of RealSense cameras, they were divided into a short-focus, user-facing and more long-focus, looking at the world - for more effective use in applications.  D400 Series cameras are made more versatile.  D415 gives a clearer picture, but has a lower speed and a more distant minimum distance.  The D435 is more suitable for AR / VR applications, as its global shutter works better with fast moving objects.  More detailed characteristics of the cameras are given in the table. <br><br><table><tbody><tr><th></th><th>  D415 </th><th>  D435 </th></tr><tr><td>  Application </td><td colspan="2" align="center">  Room / Outdoor </td></tr><tr><td>  Depth determination </td><td colspan="2" align="center">  Dual IR beam </td></tr><tr><td>  Shutter type </td><td>  Sliding </td><td>  Global </td></tr><tr><td>  Pixel size </td><td>  1.4 x 1.4 µm </td><td>  3 x 3 microns </td></tr><tr><td>  Depth field size </td><td>  63.4 ° x 40.4 ° </td><td>  85.2 ° x 58 ° </td></tr><tr><td>  Depth field resolution </td><td colspan="2" align="center">  1280 x 720 </td></tr><tr><td>  RGB stream options </td><td colspan="2" align="center">  1080p @ 30 FPS </td></tr><tr><td>  Depth range </td><td>  0.16 - 10 m </td><td>  0.11 - 10 m </td></tr><tr><td>  Camera size (W x D x H) </td><td>  99 x 20 x 23 mm </td><td>  90 x 25 x 25 mm </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  Where can RealSense technology be used?  There are a lot of options.  Here are the already mentioned AR / VR applications, autonomous robotics and computer vision, face recognition, on-the-fly video stream processing and segmentation, three-dimensional scanning and much more.  The scope of the technology is limited only by your imagination - as an original example, we can cite the <a href="https://naked.fit/">Naked</a> fitness tracker, where with the help of RealSense the system receives a “map” of the body to calculate the loads and then adjust it.  Other examples can be found, for example, in <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/intel/blog/269046/">the RealSense home test report</a> we conducted in 2016. <br><br>  We know that during the existence of Intel RealSense, many developers have discovered the world of "digital reality" with it.  Technology is improving, and we invite new enthusiasts to try it. <br><br>  Intel RealSense D400 cameras are already available for pre-order for <a href="https://click.intel.com/intelr-realsensetm-depth-camera-d435.html">$ 179 for model 435</a> and <a href="https://click.intel.com/intelr-realsensetm-depth-camera-d415.html">$ 149 for model 415</a> . </div>
