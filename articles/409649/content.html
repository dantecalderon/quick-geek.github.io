<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In Russia, the United States, France and other countries, lawsuits against Apple continue to be brought to the courts, slowing down the work of outdated iPhones.  In Moscow and the Moscow region, about a hundred such claims will be filed. <br><br>  The publication of RBC published on January 23 a message that the <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/5a6733829a794700953b09ad">court in Moscow refused to consider claims about the slowing down of the iPhone</a> .  According to the newspaper, the court “left without motion” statements of claim in which the claimant did not determine the price of the claim;  The plaintiffs were offered to correct the deficiency before February 15, 2018, or such claims will not be considered as filed and will be returned. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/93/aj/d2/93ajd26pynolvxlmrhe4atjduly.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  About a year ago, Apple released an update for the operating system for iOS, which slows down the smartphone.  Reddit users found out about this, bloggers and the media picked up the topic and as a result, <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/pochtoy/blog/296679/">Apple had to admit</a> to having an algorithm that works based on the smartphone battery status.  According to Apple, this is done to avoid inadvertently turning off the device. <br><br>  Tim Cook <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/297331/">apologized</a> to users who “might have thought that Apple deliberately slows down old smartphones,” and Apple reduced the cost of batteries from $ 79 to $ 29 for replacement in non-warranty devices for several smartphone models.  From the official release of Apple: “Our goal is to give customers the best experience.  This includes both the overall performance and the longevity of their devices as long as possible.  Lithium-ion batteries cannot meet peak current needs if they are in cold conditions, have a low charge, or are obsolete.  This could trigger the device to shut off urgently to protect its electronic components. ” <br><br>  As a result, Apple began to receive collective claims <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/attorney-james-vlahakis-of-sulaiman-law-group-ltd-lead-counsel-for-plaintiffs-in-class-action-lawsuit-against-apple-inc-300574833.html">in the United States</a> , <a href="https://regnum.ru/news/2364809.html">Canada</a> , France, Israel and other countries.  In Russia, the first lawsuit for <a href="https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/3521606">777,777 rubles</a> and with the requirement to replace the battery for free was filed on January 16, and on January 22, iPhone owners <a href="http://www.interfax.ru/russia/596451">filed 10 lawsuits</a> against Apple Rus LLC in Moscow and the Moscow Region for a total of several tens of millions of rubles.  The expenses of the plaintiffs are financed by the NFL Group in exchange for a share in the material compensation, with legal support provided by Lex Borealis.  <a href="http://www.interfax.ru/russia/595700">Several hundred more similar suits</a> are being prepared for submission to the court. <br><br>  The actions of Apple drew the attention of government agencies.  Paris prosecutors <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/society/09/01/2018/5a53efd69a79474ce08526bc">blamed the</a> company for deceiving and planning to slow down the performance of outdated iPhone models.  After the appeal of the association “Stop the obsolescence program”, the prosecutor’s office launched a preliminary investigation against the corporation.  The association is confident that "Apple has implemented a global strategy of obsolescence planned for increasing sales."  At the same time, in France on August 17, 2017, a law came into force, according to which it is considered a crime to slow down the operation of a vehicle by a manufacturer. </div>
