<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the Higher School of Business Informatics, HSE, we launched a new distance learning program for advanced training “Basics of creating projects in virtual reality”.  This is a short intensive course for two months, the goal of which is to develop in students an understanding of virtual reality technology and the development and promotion processes of VR projects.  The basis of the course is the practice of creating your project on the Unreal Engine 4. Details about the program under the cut, and you can sign up for it <a href="http://vr.hsbi.ru/">here &gt;&gt;</a> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sd/er/2x/sder2xpewbp1opidvzat5susess.jpeg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Virtual reality is a new market, which despite all the difficulties in its path, is developing by leaps and bounds.  By 2022, a tenfold market growth is expected.  Last year, according to Superdata, the market for virtual, augmented and mixed reality (XR) grew by 46% to $ 6.6 billion. Due to the sale of Oculus Go, 1 million such devices were sold since its release in May 2018;  37% increase in the local VR entertainment market;  use of AR-technology in non-gaming applications (social networks, etc.). <br><br>  The requirements for VR projects are also growing, and how to promote them in the market.  And now, in order to successfully enter the virtual reality market, there are few burning eyes - you need an understanding of the development process.  Knowledge of how to highlight the audience of your project, find and keep it.  Make it so that you want to play your game again, rather than take off your helmet rather and run to the bucket, as you feel sick.  That virtual reality was in the project not for the sake of a beautiful word and trend, but because it is the use of this technology to bring the product to a new level and everyone, including you, has an obvious answer to the question “Why is VR here?”. <br><br>  And to make it all possible only with the appropriate knowledge. <br><br>  <b>Why a distance course</b> <br><br>  For more than four years, the program of professional retraining “ <a href="http://game.hsbi.ru/">Management of game projects</a> ” has been going on at VSHBI with unchanging success.  During the eight months of full-time study, students receive knowledge that helps them determine their own path in the gaming industry, and successfully begin to move along this path.  But not everyone, especially from the regions of our country, could afford to spend eight months in Moscow to receive additional education.  And for them, as well as for those who, for one reason or another, do not have full-time education, we have created distance learning courses.  In particular, the " <a href="http://egame.hsbi.ru/">Basics of developing projects in virtual reality</a> " based on the Center of Competences on Virtual and Augmented Reality, which we have opened jointly with the AVRA Association. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hl/qq/gg/hlqqgg896suh6chjqbkgxrctyly.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>This course gives not only knowledge - but, most importantly, it is the system knowledge that will be in demand regardless of who the listener wants to become</b> - a VR developer in a company, a VR project manager or chooses an independent developer’s path.  Our course is the very foundation, owning which, the listener will be able to learn and develop further independently.  A distinctive feature is also the fact that all teachers are practitioners who not only have a lot of experience in the past, but are currently actively working in the field in which they teach.  That is why the course is filled with real-life cases and examples from practice, and also contains many practical, useful tools and recommendations.  Including - samples and templates of documentation, calculations and design documents required by any team.  Right during training, you create a game on the Unreal Engine 4. It is important to note that the specialists working on this engine are among the most sought-after and highly paid. <br><br>  <b>The training program includes the following modules:</b> <br><br>  <i>Game design projects in virtual reality</i> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AjeJ6w5rDIY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><ul><li>  Introduction to the virtual reality market. </li><li>  Target audience of VR applications. </li><li>  Features game design games on different platforms. </li><li>  Psychological perception of virtual reality by users. </li><li>  Time limits for a gaming session in VR. </li><li>  Examples of bad and good game mechanics as applied to VR. </li><li>  How to beat the entrance and exit of a player from virtual reality. </li><li>  Adaptation of famous game mechanics under VR. </li><li>  Formation of game genres under VR. </li><li>  Features of the implementation of various game mechanics in VR: shooting, magic, movement, interaction with the environment, traffic management, research, flights, PvP and more. </li><li>  Feedback to controllers in VR. </li><li>  Monetization of VR applications. </li></ul><br>  <i>Practice of creating a VR game on Unreal Engine 4</i> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TLRYsMlfZtg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><ul><li>  The fundamentals of developing projects in virtual reality on the Unreal Engine 4. </li><li>  Creating a project. </li><li>  Work with primitives and light. </li><li>  The basics of blueprint. </li><li>  Creation and appointment of materials. </li><li>  Creating an interface. </li><li>  Sound. </li></ul><br>  <i>Managing the development of a VR project.</i>  <i>Introductory UX Design Principles for Virtual Reality</i> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UNGCG7AeSB0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><ul><li>  The value of UX-design for virtual reality. </li><li>  Features of the development of UX-design for VR. </li><li>  Methodology of developing UX-design for projects in virtual reality. </li><li>  Technological solutions when working with projects in virtual reality with full immersion. </li></ul><br>  <i>Virtual reality project marketing</i> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6SmIDMr3H3w" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><ul><li>  Release work with the VR-project. </li><li>  Features launch a VR project with and without publishing. </li><li>  Marketing and PR: positioning, promotion strategy, marketing plan, marketing materials, analytics, optimization of marketing activities. </li><li>  Preparing for launch, launch and post-activity on a VR application. </li><li>  Promotional channels: platform tools, influencer, press, blogs, video content, Reddit, social networks, non-standard promotion methods.
