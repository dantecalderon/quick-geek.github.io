To the question of what logic to break, I get the answer: ‚ÄúBut take the statistics of actual sales for the 4th quarter of such a year, get the actual channel shares in% for each line of the plan and break these lines by these fractions‚Äù. <br>  In fact, this is the most frequent answer in such tasks ... <br><br>  So far everything seems simple enough. <br><br>  I get this fact (see the picture below): <br><br><ul><li>  pos_channell - sales channel (target attribute for the plan) </li><li>  fact.sales - the actual sales of something. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8t/uo/pn/8tuopnzhdexvdz9cq2c6sqftgxc.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Based on the obtained approach to ‚Äúsawing‚Äù, using the example of the first line of the plan, we will break it down on the basis of the fact, something like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/b9/ib/q0/b9ibq06zbezjvfhsf5gxkeoba4s.png" alt="image"><br><br>  However, if we compare the fact with the plan for the whole table in order to understand whether all the plan lines will be adequately ‚Äúsawed‚Äù in fractions, we get the following picture: (green color - all attributes of the plan line coincided with the fact, yellow cells did not match). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tp/vm/ta/tpvmtayhezx1cou7359wqzmds3c.png" alt="image"><br><br><ul><li>  In the 1st line of the plan, all the fields are completely found in the fact. </li><li>  Corresponding territory is not found in the 2nd line of the plan. </li><li>  In the 3rd line of the plan is missing in the fact of the brand. </li><li>  In the 4th line of the plan there is not enough in the fact of the territory and the federal district </li><li>  In the 5th line of the plan is missing in the fact of the brand and class. </li></ul><br>  As Panikovsky said: "Saw the Shura, saw it - they are golden ..." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/m3/v0/ig/m3v0ig5ao9agopnt9-7tthegaiu.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  I go to the business customer and clarify on the example of the 2nd line, what approach does he see for such situations? <br><br>  I get the answer: ‚Äúfor cases when it is impossible to calculate the share of channels for the brand number 2 in the Smolensk region (taking into account the fact that we have the Smolensk region in the Central Federal District-Central Federal District), then break this line according to the structure of channels within the entire Central Federal District!‚Äù <br><br>  That is, for the {Smolensk region + brand_2} we aggregate the fact at the level of the Central Federal District and break the Smolensk region something like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2t/pf/i1/2tpfi18n14-qytt76pydyjjwnfs.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Returning and digesting what I heard, I try to summarize it into a more universal heuristic: <br>  If there is no data at the current level of detail of the fact table, before calculating the shares for the target field (sales channel), we aggregate the fact table before the hierarchy attribute is higher. <br><br>  That is, if there is no territory, then we aggregate the fact to the hierarchy level above - the shares for the same CFD as in the plan.  If not for a brand, then according to the hierarchy above there is a class of a product - respectively, we recalculate the shares for the same class and so on. <br><br>  Those.  we combine the plan and the fact according to the coupling fields for which we count the shares in the fact and at each iteration of the remaining undisclosed plan we consistently reduce the composition of the coupling fields. <br><br>  There is already a certain pattern of data distribution: <br><br><ol><li>  We distribute the plan in fact based on the full coincidence of the corresponding fields </li><li>  We get a broken plan (we accumulate it into an intermediate result) and an unbroken plan (not all the lines coincided) </li><li>  We take an unbroken plan and break it down into a higher hierarchy level (i.e., discard the specific linkage field of these 2 tables and aggregate the fact without this field to calculate the shares) </li><li>  We get a broken plan (we add it to the intermediate result) and an unbroken plan (not all the lines coincided) </li><li>  And we repeat the same steps until there is an ‚Äúuncut‚Äù plan. </li></ol><br>  In general, no one obliges us to consistently delete coupling fields only within the hierarchy.  For example, we have already removed the brand and territory from the coupling fields, and the remaining plan was distributed according to: product_class (hierarchy is higher than brand) + Fed.krug (hierarchy is higher than territory).  And still got some unallocated balance of the plan. <br><br>  Then we can remove from the coupling fields either a product class or a federal district, since  they are no longer invested in the hierarchy of each other. <br><br>  Considering that tens of fields and rows in such tables ‚Äî up to a million ‚Äî to do such manipulations with your hands is not a pleasant task. <br><br>  And if we take into account that tasks of this kind come to me regularly at the end of each year (approval of budgets of the next year on the board of directors), then we had to transfer this process to some flexible universal template. <br><br>  And since most of the time I work with data through R, the implementation is accordingly the same on it. <br><br>  To begin, we need to write a universal magic function that will accept the base table (basetab) with the data for the breakdown (in our example, the plan) and the table for calculating the shares (sharetab) on the basis of which we will ‚Äúcut‚Äù the data (in our example, fact).  But the function must also understand what to do with these objects, so the function will also accept the vector of the fields of the hitch (merge.vrs) - i.e.  those fields which are equally named in both tables and allow us to join one table with another by these fields where it will turn out (i.e. right join).  Also, the function must understand which column of the base table must be taken in the distribution (basetab.value) and on the basis of which field the shares are counted (sharetab.value).  And the most important thing is what to take for the resulting field (sharetab.targetvars), in our case we want to detail the plan by sales channel from the fact. <br><br>  By the way, this variable sharetab.targetvars is not accidental in my plural - it can be not one field but a vector name field vector, for cases when you need to add more than one field from the table of shares from the table of shares (for example, it‚Äôs not possible to split the plan only by sales channel but also by the name of the products included in the brand). <br><br>  Yes, and one more condition :) my function should be as concise and readable as possible, without any multi-storey on 2 screens (I really don't like big functions). <br><br>  The popular dplyr package fit into the last condition as comfortably as possible, and given that its pipeline operators must understand the textual names of the fields that are lowered into the function - it was not without the <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/programming">Standart evaluation</a> . <br><br>  Here is this baby (not counting the internal comments): <br><br><pre><code class="plaintext hljs">fn_distr &lt;- function(sharetab, sharetab.value, sharetab.targetvars, basetab, basetab.value, merge.vrs,level.txt=NA) { # sharetab -

send to the next same sample iteration but broken down by shares at a higher hierarchy level. <br><br>  All the beauty and convenience is that the work goes on the same type of blocks and one universal function, all that is needed at each step (iteration) is to correct the vector merge.vrs and watch how the magic does all this tedious work for you: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rb/7x/hb/rb7xhby_9ztkha0hwfjfysslxaq.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Yes, I almost forgot a small nuance: if something goes wrong and at the very end we get a broken plan that will not be totally equal to the plan before the breakdown - it will be difficult to track at which iteration everything went wrong. <br><br>  Therefore, each iteration is supplied with a checksum: <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">–°—É–º–º–∞(–ü–ª–∞–Ω_–∏–∑–Ω–∞—á–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π)-–°—É–º–º–∞(–ü–ª–∞–Ω_—Ä–∞—Å–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π_–≤_–Ω–∞–∫–æ–ø–ª–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–º —Ä–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç–µ)-–°—É–º–º–∞(–ü–ª–∞–Ω_–Ω–µ—Ä–∞—Å–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π_–ø–æ—Å–ª–µ_—Ç–µ–∫.–∏—Ç–µ—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–∏)=0</code> </pre> <br>  Now we will try to drive our example through the distribution template and see what we get at the output. <br><br>  First, we will get the initial data: <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">library(dplyr) plan &lt;- data_frame(pos_terr = c("—è—Ä–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤—Å–∫–∞—è –æ–±–ª–∞—Å—Ç—å", "—Å–º–æ–ª–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∞—è –æ–±–ª–∞—Å—Ç—å", "–∫—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–æ–¥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏–π –∫—Ä–∞–π", "—Å–≤–µ—Ä–¥–ª–æ–≤—Å–∫–∞—è –æ–±–ª–∞—Å—Ç—å", "—Ç–æ–º—Å–∫–∞—è –æ–±–ª–∞—Å—Ç—å"), pos_fo = c("–¶–§–û", "–¶–§–û", "–Æ–§–û", "–£–§–û", "–°–§–û"), product_brend = c("brend_1", "brend_2", "brend_3", "brend_4", "brend_5"), product_class = c("class_1", "class_1", "class_2", "class_2", "class_3"), plan.sales = c(100, 200, 300, 400, 500)) fact &lt;- data_frame(pos_terr = c("—è—Ä–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤—Å–∫–∞—è –æ–±–ª–∞—Å—Ç—å", "—è—Ä–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤—Å–∫–∞—è –æ–±–ª–∞—Å—Ç—å", "–∫–∞–ª—É–∂—Å–∫–∞—è –æ–±–ª–∞—Å—Ç—å", "—Ç–≤–µ—Ä—Å–∫–∞—è –æ–±–ª–∞—Å—Ç—å", "—Ç–≤–µ—Ä—Å–∫–∞—è –æ–±–ª–∞—Å—Ç—å","–∫—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–æ–¥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏–π –∫—Ä–∞–π", "–∫—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–æ–¥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏–π –∫—Ä–∞–π", "—Ç–æ–º—Å–∫–∞—è –æ–±–ª–∞—Å—Ç—å", "—Ç–æ–º—Å–∫–∞—è –æ–±–ª–∞—Å—Ç—å", "—Ç–æ–º—Å–∫–∞—è –æ–±–ª–∞—Å—Ç—å"), pos_fo = c("–¶–§–û", "–¶–§–û","–¶–§–û","–¶–§–û", "–¶–§–û", "–Æ–§–û", "–Æ–§–û", "–°–§–û", "–°–§–û", "–°–§–û"), product_brend = c("brend_1", "brend_1", "brend_2", "brend_2","brend_2", "brend_4", "brend_4", "brend_1", "brend_2", "brend_4"), product_class = c("class_1", "class_1", "class_1","class_1","class_1", "class_2", "class_2", "class_1", "class_1", "class_2"), pos_channell = c("—Ä–æ–∑–Ω–∏—Ü–∞", "–æ–ø—Ç", "—Ö–æ—Ä–µ–∫–∞","–æ–ø—Ç", "—Ö–æ—Ä–µ–∫–∞", "—Ä–æ–∑–Ω–∏—Ü–∞", "–æ–ø—Ç", "—Ö–æ—Ä–µ–∫–∞", "—Ä–æ–∑–Ω–∏—Ü–∞", "—Ö–æ—Ä–µ–∫–∞"), fact.sales = c(16.38, 11.64, 30.73,60, 20, 6.40, 26.49, 46.63, 65.96, 98.81)) &lt;/soure&gt; –ó–∞—Ç–µ–º –∑–∞—Ä–µ–∑–µ—Ä–≤–∏—Ä—É–µ–º –æ—Å—Ç–∞—Ç–æ–∫ –Ω–µ—Ä–∞—Å–ø—Ä–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ø–ª–∞–Ω–∞ (–ø–æ–∫–∞ —á—Ç–æ —Ä–∞–≤–µ–Ω –∏—Å—Ö–æ–¥–Ω–æ–º—É) –∏ –ø—É—Å—Ç–æ–π —Ñ—Ä–µ–π–º –¥–ª—è —Ä–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç–∞. &lt;source&gt; plan.remain &lt;- plan result.total &lt;- data_frame()</code> </pre><br>  <b>1.
