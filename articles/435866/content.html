Back in the 70s <a href="https://habr.com/company/vsce/blog/427965/">, major IT companies came</a> to the city: IBM, AMD and Texas Instruments.  They made a bet on graduates of a local university. <br><br>  At that time, bar culture was developing throughout the state: new establishments were opened, where musicians experimented with vocals, instruments and texts.  The atmosphere of freedom and creative Austin of those years even devoted a musical program "Austin City Limits". <br><br>  At some point, the organizers of the New York Music Festival, New Music Seminar, turned to the editorial office of the local newspaper The Austin Chronicle with a proposal to hold their event in Austin.  Although the project was not implemented, this idea formed the basis of SXSW. <br><br>  “South by Southwest” <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_by_Southwest">beats up</a> Alfred Hitchcock’s movie title “North by Northwest” (North by Northwest).  The festival was originally conceived as a musical, but the topics were significantly expanded.  Now they are discussing movies, media, new technologies and startups.  In 1994, a CD-ROM was presented at the festival.  Later - streaming video and VR. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/e7/lu/ap/e7luapisybsgbavrkmsr133ctss.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i><sup>Brian Dooley |</sup></i></font>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i><sup><a href="https://flic.kr/p/oP4cTN">Flickr</a> |</sup></i></font>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i><sup><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/">CC BY</a></sup></i></font> <br><br>  During the festival, SXSW Accelerator worked for several years.  Over 400 startups passed through it and in total attracted about $ 5 billion of investments.  16% of these startups were bought by companies such as Google, Huffington Post, Apple and Live Nation. <br><br>  Since 2018, the SXSW Accelerator has been transformed into the SXSW Pitch event.  This is a pitching start-up competition for SXSW.  Here not only finished products (like at Release IT) are welcomed, but also projects at the idea stage.  Unfortunately, the selection at this year's SXSW Pitch is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/m1try/posts/1771155876328297">already closed</a> . <br><br>  <a href="https://www.sxsw.com/news/2019/sxsw-pitch-2019-finalists-announcement/">These projects</a> went to the SXSW Pitch event 2019 final. <br><br><h2>  Eventually </h2><br>  SXSW was conceived as a regional event, and turned into a large-scale festival, where famous musicians, politicians, representatives of corporations and young IT-companies gather. <br><br>  SXSW Release IT is a good way to present your product or service within one of the largest IT events of the year.  <a href="https://www.sxsw.com/awards/sxsw-release-it/">You can</a> apply for participation in Release IT until <b>January 17</b> .  The final of the competition - the presentations of the finalists and the announcement of the winner - will be on March 8. <br><br><hr><br><blockquote>  For two years in a row, I entered the SXSW Pitch event.  This time I am also looking at applications for SXSW Release IT.  In total, this is more than 500 project questionnaires.  I think that such experience can be useful for preparing for accelerators and other support programs. <br><br> <sup><a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-history-of-sxsw-how-it-all-started-66b9aa379ee7"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/v2/_w/dz/v2_wdzkj_w8ocrdp3qk5fg01tdw.jpeg"></a></sup>  <sup><a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-history-of-sxsw-how-it-all-started-66b9aa379ee7">SXSW: How It All Started</a></sup> <sup><br> <a href="http://blog.startupdigest.com/2018/09/04/techstars-startup-digest-from-launch-to-today/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/j_/ex/d2/j_exd2mvatonsnllotpyetqysfa.png"></a></sup>  <sup><a href="http://blog.startupdigest.com/2018/09/04/techstars-startup-digest-from-launch-to-today/">Techstars Startup Digest: From Launch to Today</a></sup> <sup><br> <a href="https-medium-com-m1try-dmitry-kabanov-the-origins-of-startup-culture-30s-b9ef8adcd13b"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cv/fi/jd/cvfijdtdcafyipbb9pvsjk9jrgm.png"></a></sup>  <sup><a href="https-medium-com-m1try-dmitry-kabanov-the-origins-of-startup-culture-30s-b9ef8adcd13b">How the Early Success Stories</a></sup> <sup><br> <a href="https://t.me/atscale/7"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></a></sup>  <sup><a href="https://t.me/atscale/7">Habr.com is scaling into English-speaking markets should</a></sup> <sup><br></sup> </blockquote></div>
