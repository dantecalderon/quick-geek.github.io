There is a task - we perform it. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  One of the frontend developers set the task to do it quickly and cheaply. </p><br><p>  From his side a legitimate proposal was received, to make him a "TK", I will give his fragment. </p><br><h3 id="tz">  TK </h3><br><ul><li>  Make the counter spin. </li><li>  To make it fast. </li></ul><br><p>  Technical assignment received, time to get down to business.  First of all, they decided to google, for sure there are already ready-made solutions or at least ideas on how to implement it. </p><br><p>  Searches failed, most likely, Yandex concealed these results. </p><br><p>  There was nothing left to do, how to once again get together with the whole department and collectively, solve the problem (did not help). </p><br><p>  When we returned to the workplaces, our artificial intelligence has already completed this task, without stopping to launch and here is "READY". </p><br><p>  If you want to join: </p><br><ol><li>  Open the stanitsa "Yandex" </li><li>  Open the developer console </li><li>  copy the code below </li><li>  press Enter </li></ol><br><pre><code class="plaintext hljs">setInterval(()=&gt;document.querySelector('.anumb__ticker').click())</code> </pre> <br><p>  Everyone is happy, there are more hearts. </p><br><p>  Make love, not war :) </p></div>
