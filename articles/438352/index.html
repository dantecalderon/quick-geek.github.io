In accordance with the calculated data, they autonomously emerged from the "lunar night mode". <br><br>  The main equipment of the apparatuses was connected in series, in accordance with the prescribed procedure, all the components of the apparatuses successfully passed the test of the first moonlit night, which confirmed the internal testing of the onboard systems. <br><br>  At present, the Yuytu-2 lunar rover is located approximately 18 meters north-west of the Chang'e-4 landing gear (landing area at 177.6 degrees south of the moon). <br><br><blockquote>  New photos of the Chang'e-4 module, taken with a camera from the Yuytu-2 rover: </blockquote><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/m2/yg/xr/m2ygxrahslfrd4vj-n6n0kyskma.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ty/dx/ec/tydxec8joyszb2txrbf9kjoudw4.jpeg"><br><br>  Both lunar devices operate in normal mode, consistently exchanging data with the Beijing Center for Aerospace Control, using the Tseuqiao satellite transponder. <br><br>  The animation below shows how to transfer data from the back of the moon. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7p/4z/3v/7p4z3vryfxpzbumjvtqwuijf_rs.gif"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/g9/rh/tf/g9rhtfkyvth3xgspyehmu3cxhtk.png"><br><br>  Communication scheme of the project elements: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jo/0-/zw/jo0-zwlfhk73ia_yynffxcxxwr0.jpeg"><br><br>  According to the data transmitted from the monitoring logs of the device temperature sensors, on the first lunar night the temperature on the lunar surface fell (minimum) to minus 190 degrees Celsius.  What turned out to be much lower than expected.  According to calculated data, it was assumed that the temperature at this time does not fall below minus 170 degrees Celsius. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúAccording to data from the Chang'e-4 and Yuyu-2 sensors, the temperature of the upper layer of lunar soil on the far side of the moon is lower than the previously measured temperature of the Apollo mission,‚Äù said Chang He, executive director of the Chang‚Äôe-4 research project. "Chinese Academy of Space Technology (CAST), -" This is probably due to the difference in the composition of the lunar soil between the two sides of the moon.</i>  <i>We still need a more thorough analysis on this issue. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  Such a low-temperature environment for a long time presents a serious problem for maintaining the full-fledged working capacity of lunar probes. <br><br>  Chang'e-4 successfully spent the moonlit night without sunlight and at a very low temperature, using an onboard radioisotope power source designed to power the systems of the Chinese lunar mission. <br><br>  Day and night on the moon are equivalent to about 28 days on Earth.  During the first lunar day, the Chang'e-4 landing gear and the Yuuta-2 rover successfully completed their first engineering tasks. <br><br>  During the second lunar day, the collection and transmission of scientific data by the Chang'e-4 apparatus and the Yuyu-2 rover will continue as planned. <br><br>  <i>"The far side of the moon has its own unique features and great potential to explore, so Chang'e-4 can make incredible discoveries," said Zou Yongliao, director of the space research department at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/me/qc/vy/meqcvylft0wsxscn8bdfxsljn5q.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pq/rk/ap/pqrkaplcodyn3uelhso7gafrbqu.jpeg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/438352/">https://habr.com/ru/post/438352/</a></p>
