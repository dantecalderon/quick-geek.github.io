<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Not so long ago, photopolymer printing was expensive and available only to professionals. <br>  Now the cost of equipment has fallen sharply due to well-known startups and mass-produced desktop (office) 3D printers from China. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sf/ot/i-/sfoti-qbs4gzknjirm80lonmrh4.jpeg"><br><br>  I bring to your attention three popular models for home use (prices from $ 229). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  What is a 3D printer, I am sure, no need to explain.  Already, many have seen FDM printing or may have used additive technologies.  But SLA (stereolithographic printing) still remained the prerogative of large firms, clinics, and so on.  Cheaper prices - the use of a special resin with ultraviolet light curing - simple LEDs and LED arrays made this type of printing available.  SLA UV printers can now be used at home.  The main costs are for consumables (photopolymer resin), since filling the bath requires a decent amount of material: 100 ml or more at a time.  The cost of a photopolymer starts from 4 thousand rubles per liter and above. <br><br>  Now in order. <br><br>  The most budget, the most affordable on the market - <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/3d-printers-3d-printer-kits/pp_009472956105.html%3Flkid%3D19090481">SparkMaker SLA UV 3D Printer photopolymer printer</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5y/tk/-s/5ytk-sqrm6yvhlkzwn7_p4r8r-c.jpeg"><br><br>  SparkMaker SLA is a successful startup that successfully combined high-quality components with a sound idea.  For printing using a simple UV photopolymer resin (405nm). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bf/r2/sx/bfr2sx9coqyupzkjldq32xth7ty.jpeg"><br><br>  The printer is compact, equipped with a protective cap, inside the bath rail guide (MGN15H).  Prints from a memory card, for the preparation of models provided corporate slicer (Spark Studio).  Available video usage, instructions, test models. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ki/1x/o6/ki1xo6uw01ojeh6y_5kahybkv4w.jpeg"><br><br>  Printing accuracy is up to 50 microns (positioning accuracy is much higher).  The size of the print area is 98 x 55 x 125 mm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pj/qs/rf/pjqsrf_ugeelu5mlstmxellp10i.jpeg"><br><br>  <i>Specifications:</i> <br>  Brand: SparkMaker <br>  Type: Complete Machine <br>  Print speed: 8 - 15 s / layer <br>  Supporting material: Resin <br>  XY-axis positioning accuracy: 0.01mm <br>  Z-axis positioning accuracy: 0.002 mm <br>  Voltage: 24V <br>  Working Power: 48W <br>  Packing Type: Assembled packing <br>  Connector Type: SD card <br>  Product weight: 2.0000 kg <br>  Package weight: 3.0000 kg <br>  Product size: 17.00 x 17.00 x 27.50 cm <br>  Package size: 34.00 x 34.00 x 34.00 cm <br><br>  You can buy a <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/3d-printers-3d-printer-kits/pp_009472956105.html%3Flkid%3D19090481">SparkMaker SLA UV 3D Printer photopolymer printer</a> in our store Gearbest, a printer in stock, free delivery to the door. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/s0/ay/jq/s0ayjqkhxnqrv9rnlfz0z9rgrqy.jpeg"><br><br>  The current price is $ 229.99 including shipping.
