The reason is a significant excess of the error rate, which was discovered after analyzing the daily monitoring data.  During decommissioning, the satellite was located above southern Africa. <br><br>  The device in question was launched into orbit on March 2, 2010; it was commissioned on March 28.  The satellite number is 731. The global network of monitoring stations <a href="https://www.glonass-iac.ru/GLONASS/DayMonitoringNew.php">includes</a> Russian stations of the SDCM network (stations in Russia and 2 stations in Antarctica) and stations of foreign organizations (IGS, Euref, TrigNet, RBMC, etc.). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Glonass-M is a second-generation navigation satellites, which have been used since 2001.  In total, 46 satellites have been launched into orbit.  The system includes 26 vehicles, 24 are used. Third-generation GLONASS-K and GLONASS-K2 devices are currently being prepared for the aging satellites. <br><br>  It is worth noting that one of the satellites of the Glonass-M series was put into orbit on June 17, 2018 using the Soyuz-2.1b rocket.  On November 3, another satellite was launched using the same rocket. </div>
