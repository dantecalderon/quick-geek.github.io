The new portion has a slightly unusual feature for the Intel Core: the lack of a graphics core, which is emphasized by the special letter F in the model names.  However, there was a place in it for the “standard” Core, which opens the class i3 in the current generation. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The top model in this family, Core i9-9900KF, has exactly the same characteristics as the previously presented Core i9-9900K, except for the absence of a graphics core.  In fact, it is physically available there, but it is disabled to increase the profitability of the production process.  The same picture with Core i7-9700KF processors Core i5-9600KF - they are identical to their predecessors up to the GPU. <br><br><table><tbody><tr><th></th><th>  Kernels / Threads </th><th>  Frequency </th><th>  Igp </th><th>  DDR4 </th><th>  Tdp </th><th>  Price </th></tr><tr><td>  <a href="https://ark.intel.com/products/190887/Intel-Core-i9-9900KF-Processor-16M-Cache-up-to-5-00-GHz-">i9-9900KF</a> </td><td>  8/16 </td><td>  3.6 / 5.0 GHz </td><td>  - </td><td>  2666 </td><td>  95 W </td><td>  $ 499 </td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="https://ark.intel.com/products/190885/Intel-Core-i7-9700KF-Processor-12M-Cache-up-to-4-90-GHz-">i7-9700KF</a> </td><td>  8/8 </td><td>  3.6 / 4.9 GHz </td><td>  - </td><td>  2666 </td><td>  95 W </td><td>  $ 385 </td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="https://ark.intel.com/products/190884/Intel-Core-i5-9600KF-Processor-9M-Cache-up-to-4-60-GHz-">i5-9600KF</a> </td><td>  6/6 </td><td>  3.7 / 4.6 GHz </td><td>  - </td><td>  2666 </td><td>  95 W </td><td>  $ 263 </td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="https://ark.intel.com/products/134898/Intel-Core-i5-9400-Processor-9M-Cache-up-to-4-10-GHz-">i5-9400</a> </td><td>  6/6 </td><td>  2.9 / 4.1 GHz </td><td>  UHD 630 </td><td>  2666 </td><td>  65 W </td><td>  $ 182 </td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="https://ark.intel.com/products/190883/Intel-Core-i5-9400F-Processor-9M-Cache-up-to-4-10-GHz-">i5-9400F</a> </td><td>  6/6 </td><td>  2.9 / 4.1 GHz </td><td>  - </td><td>  2666 </td><td>  65 W </td><td>  $ 182 </td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="https://ark.intel.com/products/191126/Intel-Core-i3-9350KF-Processor-8M-Cache-up-to-4-60-GHz-">i3-9350KF</a> </td><td>  4/4 </td><td>  4.0 / 4.6 GHz </td><td>  - </td><td>  2400 </td><td>  91 W </td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  As for the Core i3-9350KF, this is a representative of a new class: a 4-core processor with the possibility of overclocking, no hyper-trading and a graphics core, with a high base (4 GHz) and turbo (4.6 GHz) frequency.  Core i5-9400F is a six-core processor without hyper-trading and a GPU, which, on the contrary, has a low base frequency.  The Core i5-9400 is its twin brother with Gen9's integrated Intel HD 630 graphics. <br><br>  It is interesting to note that the F character has once been featured in the names of Intel processors, but it was a Xeon with an embedded OmniPath matrix.  And now it stands for the mass Core model with no graphics core - Intel has not had such products for a very long time.  Obviously, the goal is to reduce the technological culling, when the computational cores are working normally, and the graphics do not correspond to the required characteristics. <br><br>  According to official information, the start of sales of new processors is expected in the first quarter of this year.  It will be interesting to see whether the absence of a graphics core will affect overclocking or, conversely, on energy efficiency indicators.  Perhaps you tell about it when you try it yourself? </div>
