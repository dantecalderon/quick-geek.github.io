<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  According to a survey conducted after writing the first <a href="https://habr.com/en/post/438530/">article</a> of the “Podcasts for hipsters” column, the <strike>toxic</strike> wayward public Habra accepted it quite positively and wanted to continue (at the time of writing this article, the previous rating is +3, which undoubtedly can be considered a great success). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fs/vr/pz/fsvrpz3libqe7qohaihysbygi_w.jpeg"></div><br><br>  In the second edition of this most popular column, I decided to tell you about the podcast about web development <a href="https://uwebdesign.ru/">“uWebDesign (Severe Web)”</a> . <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  At the time of this writing, 192 issues are available.  The podcast is weekly, goes to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZeU17nbVfzczAkJVTay9vw">YouTube</a> (in the form of a screencast with commentaries from the presenters) and on all major podcast platforms ( <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/podcast/uwebdesign-mysli-ob-it-i-web/id923355344%3Fmt%3D2">iTunes</a> / <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6Mpd7URNBZe2NqKkmldDzt">Spotify</a> / <a href="https://player.fm/series/uwebdesign-115642">PlayerFM</a> ). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vs/dj/a0/vsdja0h6gzzno4chiwuatylfphe.jpeg"></div><br><br>  The podcast is led by two guys from Chelyabinsk: <br><br><ul><li>  Alexander Goncharov ( <a href="https://twitter.com/websanya">@websanya</a> ) <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rv/ag/n4/rvagn4ycqonxcykhdyiwmv8tcou.jpeg" width="200" height="210"></div><br>  According to the description of his twitter - a web-scientist and artist who consults and makes WordPress sites, as well as struggling with entropy and practicing order. </li><li>  Nikita Tarasov ( <a href="https://twitter.com/voodooue">@voodooue</a> ) <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ob/nx/kr/obnxkrz_9i0pl1vmp5qz1knlhsm.jpeg" width="200" height="210"></div><br>  Podcast's headliner: if it weren't for his burr, then the number of listeners of the “Stern Web” would be less than 50 percent. in the podcast less ridiculous. </li></ul><br><br>  I've been listening to these guys for about a year.  In their releases, they usually discuss articles on UI / UX, JavaScript, PHP and other topics and express their opinions on this.  By the way, anyone can suggest a podcast theme (this can be done on their <a href="https://uwebdesign.ru/">website</a> ).  A sense of humor is a very subjective thing, but for these guys it is definitely present. <br><br>  I would like to wish the guys further development of their project (and adding a webcam when recording releases: it’s very interesting to watch screencasts, but if you can see the commentators themselves leading somewhere in the corner, then I’m sure it will not look less than this) . <br><br>  PS: Please indicate in the comments which domestic podcasts you would like to see in this section. </div>
