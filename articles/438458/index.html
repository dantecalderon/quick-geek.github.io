Reports will go in 8 streams: Backend, Frontend, Mobile, Testing and QA, Devops, Design, Science and Management.  Plus workshops and afterparty. <br><br>  In this post - the topics that we want to discuss in the sections Frontend, Backend, Science and instructions on how to become a speaker.  We also came up with something interesting for speakers who want to not only speak, but also communicate with other speakers and see Yekaterinburg.  Under the cut all the details. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KcdlxGKDKX8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>A little video about how last year‚Äôs DUMP went.</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <b>What is DUMP</b> </h2><br>  For those who do not know, <a href="http://dump-ekb.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3D1_02">DUMP</a> (Development. Usability. Management. Practice) is the largest developer conference, which has been held in Yekaterinburg since 2011.  In 2018, she gathered 1,500 people from Yekaterinburg, Chelyabinsk, Tyumen, Ufa, Kurgan, Moscow, Izhevsk, Perm and other cities. <br><br>  Last year, we were made by Grigory Bakunov (Yandex), Alexey Akulovich (VKontakte), Sergey Abdulmanov (Mosigra), Alexey Savvateev (CEMI RAS), Alexander Burt, Zarema Khalilova (Uploadcare), Alexey Migutsky (Microsoft), Seryozha Popov (HTML Academy), Oleg Anastasyev (Odnoklassniki) and 45 more cool speakers. <br><br>  All videos of last year's reports can be viewed on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/videoitpeople/playlists">YouTube channel</a> .  Separately laid out <a href="https://disk.yandex.ru/d/YXGThWYk3UV8ud">presentations</a> and <a href="https://yadi.sk/a/xsyoRjP23YuYLx">photos</a> . <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qYkF5S0Y0sY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>One of the best reports of the last year is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DqYkF5S0Y0sY%26list%3DPLRdS-n5seLRpplXdNABKrLhomDTHz5UIg%26index%3D8">‚ÄúThe nepahan field of bigdats in medicine and pharmaceutics‚Äù</a> by Gregory Bakunov</i> <br><br><h2>  <b>Program committee</b> </h2><br>  Program directors invite speakers, review applications, select the most useful and interesting ones, help the speakers prepare, arrange rehearsals for performances and do everything possible to make an excellent program. <br><br>  This year's Backend section is being prepared for you: <b>Andrei Zharinov</b> , head of the Yandex development office, <b>Konstantin Beklemishev</b> , head of the development department at Naumen Contact Center, and <b>Denis Tarasov,</b> software engineer from Kontur. <br><br>  The Frontend section is done by: Frontend-architect at the Tochka bank, <b>Vladimir Sannikov,</b> and the organizers of the URAL JS - DevRel Expert in Konure, <b>Anastasia Kataeva,</b> and the lead software engineer in Kontur, <b>Valery Kuzmin</b> .  The section is being done with the participation of the HTML Evangelist HTML Academy, the head of the Web Standards community <b>Vadim Makeyev</b> . <br><br>  This year, the Science section is answered by: scientist, Ph.D. in Physics and Mathematics <b>Viktor Grishchenko</b> (TU Delft), <b>Alexey Kirpichnikov</b> , head of the devops-division in Kontur, and <b>Gleb Alshansky,</b> chief of neural networks at Jet.Team. <br><br><h2>  <b>I want to speak at DUMP-2019</b> </h2><br>  The program directors of the Frontend, Backend and Science sections wrote addresses to speakers and described topics that are of interest to us.  If you have something to say on one of the topics below and you want to speak, <a href="http://dump-ekb.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3D1_02">write to</a> us.  Any formats are possible: report (40 min), blitz-report (10-20 minutes), master class, workshop.  Applications are accepted until February 20, after which the program committee will form the final program. <br><br>  If you have not seen any topic in the list, but want to speak with her, <a href="http://dump-ekb.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3D1_02">send a request</a> anyway.  Perhaps the program committee will decide that the report will be super-useful and include it in the program. <br><br>  We will describe the topics of the remaining sections in a separate post. <br><br><h3>  <b>Backend</b> </h3><br>  This year we want to listen to those who write in Python, Java, C # and in general C-like languages.  We also want to find useful reports for .NET developers.  We are waiting for the history of success and failure to move from Python to Go: tell us about the reasons, give the arguments, show how it all ended. <br><br>  Voice interfaces unload our hands and simplify life.  Write to us if you have cases on the development of ASR and TTS engines and their use.  It would be interesting to hear how speech recognition and speech synthesis technologies are implemented in your company. <br><br>  We are still waiting for reports on the architecture of large and very large products and on Deep Learning (ML | DL framework), in particular, on cloud computing on video cards (GPU in Azure and alternatives). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ha/2x/mv/ha2xmvanhcjj8t-fspqu76axqwe.jpeg"><br>  <i>Last year, Oleg Anastasiev from Odnoklassniki <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DA5UBYqyBqY4%26index%3D1%26list%3DPLRdS-n5seLRobQggi_ScehmVg_2KBr63o">told</a> about OneCloud architecture</i> <br><br><h3>  <b>Frontend</b> </h3><br>  We are looking for reports in Russian and English language lasting from 10 to 45 minutes.  If you have never spoken anywhere - no problem.  We will help you think through the structure, collect the content and rehearse the performance. <br><br>  For inspiration, we have prepared a list of topics that interest us.  The list is not exhaustive, we are open to the new and are considering any applications. <br><br>  Key topics: <br><br><ul><li>  Tools: IDE, plugins, linters, assemblers </li><li>  Methodologies, architecture and principles: SOLID, microservices, BEM </li><li>  Optimization: performance, memory management, WebAssembly </li><li>  Server development: Node.js, V8, ChakraCore </li><li>  State Management: Redux, MobX, Flux </li><li>  Synchronization and data storage on the client: REST, GraphQL, Web Sockets </li><li>  Mobile Development: PWA, ReactNative, VueNative </li><li>  Desktop applications: Electron, NW.js </li><li>  Security: hacking and protection, vulnerabilities in npm </li><li>  ECMAScript: New Specifications </li><li>  Alternatives to JS: Typescript, ClojureScript, Elm, Dart </li><li>  Testing: Selenium, Unit Tests, TDD </li><li>  Framework: React, Angular, Vue </li><li>  Styles: preprocessors, CSS Modules, CSS-in-JS, Styled Components </li><li>  Graphics: SVG, WebGL, VR </li><li>  Accessibility: semantics, ARIA, screen readers </li><li>  Prototyping: Figma, design systems </li><li>  Fan: IoT, Game Dev, experiments </li><li>  Stories: successes and failures, interaction with business </li><li>  Others: Web API, future standards, open source, package managers, etc. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vo/mj/d0/vomjd0zpp1owdjdfycxlxhebv44.jpeg"><br>  <i>At DUMP-2018, organizer of pitercss_conf, pitercss_meetup, moscowcss and WSD, Seryozha Popov, gave a talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DPgeyKRHlqnM%26list%3DPLRdS-n5seLRoyY8tjEUDzvxr19JtTLFUf%26index%3D2">‚ÄúCSS vs Preprocessors - back to the future!‚Äù</a></i> <br><br><h3>  <b>Science</b> </h3><br>  The "Science" section last year did not always accommodate everyone to listen to what scientists have been working on for the past 5 years and what awaits us in the next 5. This year we intend to repeat the success and have already ordered more bean bags. to accommodate everyone. <br><br>  We are waiting for speakers from the areas of exact sciences: computer science and applied mathematics, genetic engineering, cosmology and geoengineering. <br><br>  A few topics that we would take in the section. <br><br><ul><li>  Exoskeletons - for war, rehabilitation and work.  Can make a costume of a man superman? </li><li>  Blockchain - life after HYIP.  We expect that scientists, unlike those who like easy money, take blockchain technologies seriously and continue to dig.  We expect forecasts about technologies that will ‚Äúshoot‚Äù in the near future. </li><li>  Computer security and cryptography.  Vulnerabilities in processors, wi-fi -security.  As well as the theme of the endless merging data from the same Facebook.  How, by whom and why is this data used?  And ways to protect data at a non-personal level. </li><li>  Separately, we are waiting for the topic of manipulating data, in particular the election system, from a mathematical point of view.  We are not interested in why this is done, but how. </li><li>  Alternative energy: which technology will solve the problem of rising energy costs?  How will she change our life in the next 5-10-20 years? </li><li>  Distributed DB.  The topic is so difficult that the optimal solution has not yet been found.  Or found?  Write to us if you have created or are working with something more efficiently than Cassandra or Tarantool. </li><li>  If you have visited Very Large Data Bases 2018 and are ready to make a survey report on the most relevant topics, send an application. </li><li>  Robotics: what's new in the last 5 years?  If you can talk about robots the way <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/robert_full_on_engineering_and_evolution">Robert Full</a> does, email us immediately :) </li><li>  And, of course, Data Science: practical application in production, medicine, commerce, etc.  We are interested in non-survey and introductory lectures. </li></ul><br>  We are waiting for those who, as the main work, are engaged in the field of science about which he talks, or applies the results of this scientific field in his work.  In this case, it is not necessary to talk about your result - we do not expect Perelman to come to us to talk about the Poincar√© hypothesis. <br><br>  We have two main requirements for speakers (besides knowledge of the subject area): <br><br><ol><li>  To be able to explain your topic so that it can be understood by a student of 1-2 courses of a technical college (not Losers). </li><li>  Be able to uncover a topic in 40 minutes. </li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xx/q-/pb/xxq-pboqvkn_kwofeiehxcl_3i0.jpeg"><br>  <i>A well-known popularizer of mathematics Alexei Savvateev made last year in the Science section an elegant report <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D8OPyxZXPMW4%26list%3DPLRdS-n5seLRpplXdNABKrLhomDTHz5UIg%26index%3D4">‚ÄúGame Theory and Problems of a Large City‚Äù</a></i> <br><br><h2>  <b>New for speakers DUMP-2019</b> </h2><br>  This year we decided to make an unusual place for speakers who want not only to give a lecture, but also to talk and watch Yekaterinburg.  We called this place "nest".  The nest is a good hostel with a large kitchen-living room in the center of Yekaterinburg, which we will completely rent for the speakers. <br><br>  The day after the speech, the speakers, the organizers and the program committee will gather in the nest for lunch, and then they will go for a walk around the city with fans of the back streets of Yekaterinburg.  We want to show you really interesting places of our city.  You will learn how Sverdlovsk was changed by idealist constructivists, what is in the dungeons in the city center, how athletes became the most terrible power in the city, and why buildings in Yekaterinburg are talking.  And then you can continue the spiritual gatherings in the nest. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/of/az/lv/ofazlvndo9jh-khogkv-2hnag48.jpeg"><br>  <i>Last year's participants</i> <br><br><h2>  <b>I want to become a sponsor</b> </h2><br>  DUMP sponsorship is a great opportunity to tell Ural developers, development department heads, designers, testers and analysts about their company, products and new projects.  Who <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12a43PzAjDIQZuK0EOt_S7mRXxTNE71rcfE1ylhUCuSU/edit">cares</a> , look at the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12a43PzAjDIQZuK0EOt_S7mRXxTNE71rcfE1ylhUCuSU/edit">file with the details</a> . <br><br>  We love that sponsors move on in a fun and unusual way, so during breaks we always have a lot of activities.  If you want to sponsor, but you have no idea how to make it interesting and effective, write to us, we will help. <br><br>  Here are some of the activities that took place last year. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/v5/jd/wm/v5jdwmepcfxkau4ywoqrue5x0zk.jpeg"><br>  <i>Innopolis played a bunch of prizes, including a trip to Innopolis</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ew/pa/ir/ewpair029ppyxqbp_u8dyr_tm2s.jpeg"><br>  <i>ProSoft made a very interesting stand on which everyone could conduct physical experiments and feel the effect on themselves.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/b4/cj/3h/b4cj3hyw5ctjehpipani4xdfjqc.jpeg"><br>  <i>Tinkoff.ru organized a beautiful home</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/el/h7/ga/elh7gamrcp336ewdknagudlefe0.jpeg"><br>  <i>IT conference without virtual reality is not IT conference</i> <br><br><h2>  <b>I want to participate</b> </h2><br>  Registration will open on February 6, and until February 16 you can buy a ticket at the lowest price - 5,000 rubles.
