<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The developers of the CATIA solution at Dassault Systèmes have demonstrated new technologies for modeling cars by example. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/az/qk/tu/azqktu0kaluvuo2msa3j2ajf02w.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Dassault Systèmes, a leader in 3D design, digital prototyping and product lifecycle management (PLM) solutions, decided to show in its Bleu project how you can implement your own concept car using the latest modeling technologies. <br><br>  Design concept car "Bleu": <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tE6dmMOB3Ho" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The Bleu project team included a designer, two sketch design specialists, two visualization experts, two surface modeling specialists, and one design engineer.  The Objet260 Connex 3D printer was purchased, which played an important role in the precise implementation of the project. <br><br>  The project “Bleu” was logically divided into five stages. <br><br>  <b>At the first stage, the</b> team checked their ideas on reduced samples printed on a 3D printer and not exceeding 5 cm in length.  This made it possible to identify in advance potential design flaws. <br><br>  <b>At the second stage</b> , 3D samples 10 cm long were prepared for studying and working out the concept car proportions.  Designers and designers were convinced that in terms of volume perception and proportions, all elements are perfectly balanced. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hf/hb/zw/hfhbzw1ek0wdwuq6awgu__hbone.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>3D-model with a length of 10 cm, printed on a printer Objet260 Connex</i> <i><br></i> <br><br>  <b>The third stage of the</b> project, without which the automotive industry cannot do without, is the manufacture of a model for testing in a wind tunnel.  So far she has no such details as wheels and mirrors;  not worked interior. <br><br>  After testing in a wind tunnel, the Bleu concept car <b>at the fourth stage</b> was refined and increased in length to 26 centimeters (this is a limitation of the Objet260 Connex printer tray).  But she had wheels, mirrors and bumpers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vk/7h/hk/vk7hhkrs8rfrdklsk6wsz8g4xcu.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Simplified aerodynamic models printed on a 3D printer, ready for aerodynamic testing</i> <br><br>  <b>At the final stage</b> of the “Bleu” project, a fully functional concept car model was printed.  Engineers made changes to the chassis design so that the wheels could move like a real car.  The design of the new chassis was carried out in CATIA Natural Shape;  By the beginning of the EuroMold 2013 exhibition, the model was completely ready. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yx/hs/yh/yxhsyhqhveu6ui-ny-lzemwchwu.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Chassis concept car Bleu: wheels rotate and turn left-right</i> <br><br>  Learn more about the layout process: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Coc_jS6qniw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  To print on a 3D printer, the developers of the Bleu model used several types of PolyJect materials, including black elastic TangoBlackPlus for the manufacture of tires, solid matte white VeroWhitePlus for printing the chassis and transparent VeroClear for the manufacture of windows. <br><br>  Although initially Dassault Systèmes wanted only to demonstrate the design and design capabilities of the CATIA solution with the help of the Bleu project, it was subsequently decided to share technical details of the project implementation and publish STL files of the three-dimensional model to familiarize the wide audience. <br><br>  Let us tell you a little more directly about the <b>process of preparing a three-dimensional model for 3D printing</b> . <br><br>  The process of preparing a three-dimensional model for 3D printing covers work in various applications that help prepare three-dimensional geometry depending on printing conditions.  First, the model should be team / non-demountable.  Secondly - the possibility of printing from different materials should be provided. <br><br>  Dassault Systèmes solutions portfolio also covers the process of additive manufacturing.  This process includes the development and design of three-dimensional geometry, as well as generating design technology.  Moreover, it provides tools for calculating and analyzing the model itself at operational loads, as well as calculating the printing process on the machine.  There are all the necessary tools for the layout of the tray, the construction of the reference geometry for printing and the creation of control print programs. <br><br>  The step-by-step process for preparing for 3D printing in CATIA 3DEXPERIENCE is shown on the slide: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qm/3s/yx/qm3syx01xyza4zz-kafoj_yynli.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  For a more detailed acquaintance with the CATIA functionality, we offer you to look at a webinar containing an excerpt of materials about the main improvements and innovations in 3DEXPERIENCE CATIA 2019. This review announced information about new applications, reviewed a number of improvements.  The review contains advanced designs and tooling proposals for designers, designers and system architects. <br><br> <a href="https://discover.3ds.com/ru/webinar-3dexperience-catia-2019%3Futm_campaign%3D201812_RUSSIA_2018-12-local-oo-3dexperiencecatia-webcast-russia-ru_OP54884_Terralife%26utm_medium%3Dpaidsocial%26utm_source%3Dhabr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tj/iv/ui/tjivuih9ndfktnlptegifbrvaxg.jpeg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  <a href="https://www.3ds.com/ru/produkty-i-uslugi/catia/">Read more about CATIA</a> <br><br>  <a href="https://www.3ds.com/ru/">Dassault Systèmes official page</a> <br><br>  Subscribe to Dassault Systèmes in social networks: <br><br>  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DassaultSystemesRussia/">Facebook</a> <br>  <a href="https://vk.com/3dsrussia">Vkontakte</a> <br>  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/dassaultsystemes/">Linkedin</a> <br>  <a href="http://blogs.3ds.com/russia/">3DS Blog WordPress</a> <br>  <a href="https://render.ru/ru/3DS">3DS Blog on Render</a> <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/ds/">3DS Blog on Habr</a> </div>
