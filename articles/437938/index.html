In my opinion, things are far from being so hopeless - very often to realize the fact of being in virtual reality is quite banal logic and observation, able to reveal common features between the realities you have in sensations and the virtual worlds created by people. <br><br>  In this article, I tried to systematize the “inborn vices” of the worlds created by people, to search for similar patterns in the reality that is considered to be real. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ol><li>  Limit the maximum possible speed.  Without this limitation, the impact on the virtual world may be too global and new areas will not have time to download from the server.  Therefore, a restriction on too fast commutation is introduced into the world - when developing, a limit on the maximum possible speed is built into the physics of the world, which is tied to one of the constants - for example, to the speed of light.  The latter, at the same time, can be prescribed to ridiculously tiny.  If in the world where you live, the light flies to the satellite of the planet for more than a second, I have bad news for you .... </li><li>  Artifacts of previous releases.  No one is building a virtual world from scratch.  For example, fragments of the Fallout 76 code were assigned by y Fallout 4 and Skyrim.  While programming the zverozhog, the developers simply took and created the dragon model from Skyrim.  Therefore, carefully examine your world - are there creatures or phenomena that are physically impossible in the final version?  It’s quite simple to distinguish them from creatures or phenomena - inherent in your world - the already mentioned dragon flew and glowed with fire in Skyrim with the help of magic.  And since there is no magic in Fallout 76, the flights and the emission of fire by the sergo-god are a direct indication of the artificiality of the world, since they contradict the physics and biology of that area.  Of course, the dragon / zverozhog is a textbook example of a similar error made at the very dawn of the creation of virtual worlds.  In search of such errors, you may have to dig deeper.  In the most direct sense - in one of the modern virtual worlds, when copying from a previous geology project, along with it were copied the bones of huge animals that local residents began to find in the ground.  At the same time, local science did not at all consider this phenomenon inexplicable, despite the size of animals, impossible at the current level of gravity, by several times larger than the size of all existing living beings. </li><li>  And again we turn to physics.  All programmers know the so-called "Magic numbers."  In short, this type of crutches is a numeric constant that is added to the code so that the ends meet at the ends.  If for the functioning of your world it is necessary to enclose a logbook defining the essence of reality under the wheels, in the sense of introducing an amendment to some kind of "cosmological constant", congratulations: your world was created not only artificially, but also carelessly. </li><li>  Abundance of NPCs.  According to the release of peacekeepers, the number of some virtual worlds is approaching ten billion people - which is many times more than the number of possible living users.  But this is a seeming paradox - in fact, most of the population of such worlds are computer-controlled characters.  How to distinguish them from the players?  By stereotyped and simplified behavior.  For example, NPCs are passive - they will never take quests, write comments or participate in the discussion.  If in the world where you live, the number of unique commentators on the largest social news site is from 1% to 3% of the number of readers, then ... you already understand, right? <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Margin note</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The author of the note participated in testing the virtual world, where the NPCs were programmed with a funny feature - they blindly believed the news broadcast on local TV channels, putting them in terms of confidence level noticeably higher than the reality senses accessible to their bodies.  I can not say whether this behavior arose as a result of a programmer's error, or was a joke - I can only note that the dialogues between the NPCs going on foot due to high gasoline prices in the suburbs to dig into the abandoned kolkhoz fields of frozen rutabaga, how hearty and freely began to live in recent years, according to the level of absurdity, they were approaching the best creations of Eugene Ionesco and Alina Vituhnovskaya.  And this is not even the funniest case - in the same project, part of the NPC, whose code was stupidly copied from the discworld project, knew that their world was flat.  It was impossible to convince them, raising them on a rocket or showing a ship leaving the horizon, this part of the code was protected from being overwritten. <br></div></div></li><li>  Universe as a backdrop.  You've probably heard about the Fermi paradox.  The one about the great silence of the cosmos.  "If the cosmos is so ancient and without a border, then where are all these myriad technologically advanced races that were supposed to live in our neighborhood?"  Scientists, of course, managed to come up with a dozen different solutions to the paradox — besides the simplest — what kind of life do you expect from a curtain closing the stage?  With increasing distance from the focus of the creators' intention, the complexity of the artificial world must fall - for no one models the central city and the secondary quest of the secondary quest visited by one player a year with the same zeal.  If in your world there is a difficult life only in the center of your universe, and the neighboring worlds are whipped up empty and boring blocks, then ... </li><li>  Inheritance error  Virtual reality, of course, contains many undocumented implementation features.  Let me explain with an example: Create a “New Bitmap” file on your desktop.  It is empty and has zero size.  Now we will open its properties and change the application with which we will tear off this file on notepad.  From the user's point of view, the size and content of the file has not changed, it is as empty as it was.  But bad luck, now it opens with a notebook.  Imagine how this should puzzle the scientists of the virtual world?  After all, there the properties will not inherit at all the files, but the “physical” ones - in their reality, the objects.  Imagine their bewilderment when they notice, for example, that white women, whose first lovers were negros, contrary to science and logic there, give birth to black and curly babies from their white husbands, even years after that first connection?  I am sure that since this contradicts all local science, an amusing situation will arise when the same scientists, formally vehemently denying such facts, will take measures in everyday life, for example, when breeding dogs, in order to avoid similar inheritance of properties. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Margin note</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  And I have not yet touched the direct bugs of the engine: in one of the virtual worlds, due to an error with a comma, the medicinal effect of a substance successively diluted with water did not decrease - but increased.  This worked, naturally, not everywhere, but only in individual laboratories, subject to a number of conditions that dictated the remnants of the failed script.  But these are details.  The reaction of the local scientists, who staged a nearly full-fledged crusade against doctors, was quite amusing, as they quite successfully treated the flu with barbaric duck's liver diluted to infinitely small proportions.  Out of the way laughing, I witnessed the second part of the Marlezonsky ballet - when, with the next update, the bug was largely eliminated and the diluted drugs became no more useful than the water from which the pharmacists, in general, did not stop trading, arguing that funds work. <br></div></div></li><li> 7. Ridiculous and irrational physics.  Recall, for a start, the rules of epicycle: <br><br>  First: Scientists, in an attempt to pull an erroneous theory on experimental data, come up with ridiculous torus on wheels, designed to smooth out contradictions.  (This name came from the Middle Ages, when mathematicians, in order to preserve the geocentric system of the world, epicycles were invented - designed to explain the illogical, in their model, wobble of the planets as they move through the sky) <br><br>  and second: The absurdity and stupidity of epicycles is noticeable only after the appearance of a new theory that eliminates them.  The epicycles that invented them to medieval scholars seemed logical and beautiful abstractions. <br><br>  Now, armed with these rules, look at the physics of your world with an armed eye.  What is the obvious fit of the answer to the result in an attempt to explain the operation of the reality code through the "physical properties of objects"?  Do you have light is a form of matter, possessing both the properties of particles and the properties of waves?  Yah?  You do not see anything strange in this?  Seriously?  Can a zero have unit properties?  Okay.  And quantum entanglement?  Are you afraid of the "frightening long-range"?  Not?  Einstein was frightened, but you were not afraid.  Good.  Well, and two sets of rules - physical laws, for micro and macro world, can you explain otherwise than by code optimization, which simplifies the calculation of the behavior of large physical objects?  Do not see the logic in this?  Oh well… </li><li>  The playhouses of the mind of the game character are not in the skull box - the brain, exactly like the muscles, skin and bones, is nothing more than a game convention.  Thinking is too complicated a process to trust its implementation to a simulated body - it is implemented directly in the executable code and translated into the body.  So the trauma of the character’s head does not directly affect this external process - just to preserve the authenticity, in the case of brain damage, the game makes corresponding changes in the code of thinking.  Or not - like everything else in the game, this relationship may not work due to a failure.  If in your world curious cases are known, when people whose brain was destroyed by illness and (or) accidentally piercing their heads with iron scrap, continued to live peacefully on, then ... local science will undoubtedly find a “logical” explanation, isn't it? <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Margin note</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Personally, when testing, the local scientists especially entertained the owl on the globe by explaining the funny bug associated with the “Thinking - Body” bundle to realize the interaction of the human body model with the physical world, with a response time like in reality, speed is necessary, which contradicts the speed limit of light introduced into the game.  It would seem that there is nothing complicated: thinking is realized in the reality code that is independent of the physical limitations of the world and needs to be simply transferred into the body.  In the arms and legs for performance and in the brain to "emulate the process of thinking" in this bag of fat with synapses.  But scientists who explore the brain of the virtual world noticed that a person’s hands and legs begin to move faster than the brain “makes a decision” - and just give birth to a bunch of epicycles.  We agreed to the fact that human consciousness does not affect his behavior - and is a useless superstructure, which simply comments on the splintering chicks of a carcass.  Shrub <br></div></div></li><li>  Foresight.  Many NPCs have a pre-recorded fate.  So in the virtual world, the advancement along the storyline is realized.  After a failure, some NPCs get access to this data - they remember not only their past, but also the future.  And his, and his world.  When Wanga said in 1980: “Kursk will go under water, and the whole world will mourn him” - she really knew about the death of a submarine.  At the same time, keep in mind that forecasts can be voiced not only by the NPS - a completely random person can also get access to the general scenario of the development of the world.  In this case, the knowledge of the future will be realized through prophetic dreams and insights.  In the world I was testing, for example, the future of the state was described with frightening accuracy in the cycle of cartoons by the artist Corruptor. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Margin note</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  I will try to play the role of the prophet Predict: In the coming years, cryptographic protocols, the main factors in the complexity of decomposition of the number will be compromised by the emergence of a new type of computer, clicking such tasks as nuts.  In fact, of course, computer scientists will simply learn to shift the solution of the problem from the computer created in virtual reality into the executable code of reality that is devoid of physical limitations.  What they come up with this explanation is not important: the calculations will be made by “qubits”, “food warmers”, “specially trained termites” ... <br></div></div></li><li>  Variability of history.  Being inside the virtual world, the player may notice the results of the work of patches that correct the story.  Here you need to make a reservation - if the correction patch was really large, like a patch to remove the prohibited destructive cult from virtual worlds, then not only Easter eggs and direct references inserted by programmers will be removed, but all direct references to the cult in history and literature.  In the same way, the memories of the players and the NPC, who, after cleaning, will be genuinely perplexed, will be edited - what, what kind of pyramid with an eye is depicted on their banknotes?  But, in addition to large patches, there are minor ones - when only the world is subjected to correction, without affecting the players' minds.  A funny example is the situation when, after a complaint from Toei Animation, I had to remove from the history of the virtual world the end of the cartoon "Around the World in 80 Days" already seen by users.  As a result, a ridiculous situation has arisen - when a significant part of the population of a huge country remembers the final series of the animated series, with the cabs in London and the battle inside the huge hours, but when they try to reconsider they learn that the animated series ends in the middle of the adventure - where the heroes cross America. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Margin note</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The author himself, testing the virtual world, tried to find, for argumentation in a dispute about interference with elections, a photograph of the then-former president, whom a political strategist from a competitor’s country teaches to smile, stretching the poor corners of his lips with his hands.  I did not find it - the photo has already been removed from the current version of reality, remaining only in the memories of the players.  Also, the 1996 article was deleted from Komsomolskaya Pravda, where Vanga’s prediction was given that Kursk would sink - the article was remembered by many, but scans from a million-volume newspaper that was “not preserved”. <br></div></div></li><li>  Everywhere repeating patterns.  In old games, sand and grass often seemed woven from squares - having created the texture of a small fragment of the surface, the programmer, without further ado, simply repeated it many times.  The human eye easily noticed all these repetitive pictures.  After the generation of the surface was transferred to the algorithms, this “square-nested” design method was not put to scrap, but was adapted to the new conditions.  Why write to the virtual world a unique story?  Let's write a small template and fill the story with it, copying as many times as necessary, changing only the dates and names.  It is easy to notice - the original world develops exponentially, so that when copying, “empty centuries” inevitably arise - periods copied from the early stages of the development of society and inserted between more developed fragments. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Margin note</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  A small addition: As a rule, the virtual world at launch already has a thousand-year history created in advance.  But finding out the date of the project start is still quite simple: it is indicated as zero time in computer systems, where it is listed without any camouflage: ... the starting point is midnight (UTC) from December 31, 1969 to January 1, 1970. <br></div></div></li><li>  Creating the artistic content of the fictional world is not easy - the time spent writing the original book for virtual reality is comparable to writing a book for a regular publication.  That is why the original literature, created for the virtual world, such as "Lustful Argonian Maiden" - as a rule, has a ridiculously modest volume.  That is why, the literature and history of the virtual world, as a rule, is simply copied from open sources, with minimal processing by scripts.  Because of this, the history of virtual worlds is replete with oddities disassembled in paragraph 2.  For example, in the world I have mentioned more than once without magic, in historical documents it was possible to find a stripped-down and absurd version of the fight against magic covens.  It is absurd that there is no magic in their world and there has never been any magic - and hundreds of thousands of magick, in their version of history, were burned at the stake without any reason.  With literature, the situation is somewhat simpler - when you copy a book into the virtual world, the genre simply changes - this is how well-known authors of best-selling documentary books in our world occupy the top of the top science fiction writers.  That is why I do not exclude that my brief review of ways to find out that you are in the virtual world, will be read in the virtual worlds - the article will simply be copied by another peacemaker, along with the rest of the literature. </li></ol><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What can I advise readers who have noticed that many of the virtual reality errors I described are inherent in their “real” world? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do not despair - if you read and understand this text, then you are grown in this reality of artificial intelligence, and not based on a couple of pages of the NPC code. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You have inalienable rights, the observance of which is monitored by supervisory authorities. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After the "death" of your body, you, depending on the project, will either be rewritten into another character, with a memory lock, or you will be placed on a separate cloud service, where you will meet other minds, or add a single supermind to your knowledge and experience. their database.</font></font><br><br><div class="spoiler"> <b class="spoiler_title"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Scene after captions</font></font></b> <div class="spoiler_text"> Что же касается моего основного проекта, романа #даша_на_луне, то он успешно движется к финалу, перевалив за 600 тысяч знаков. Успешно движется к взрывному финалу, спасаясь от настигающей её лунной ночи и Дарья, наматывая километр за километром на «КРАСАВИЦЕ МАРУСЕ» — собранном второпях лунном ровере. <br><br> К весне, думаю, роман будет вычитан и опубликован на одной из площадок для скачивания. Практически полностью, с завершенной сюжетной линией. <br><br> Финальная глава: «Девушка стоимостью в девять миллиардов долларов» будет доступна только в бумажной версии, но описываемые в ней события являются скорее подведением итогов, не затрагивая космическое приключение. Так же печатную версию я планирую дополнить справочным материалом, описывающим использованную в романе реально существующую технику и существенно расширить (в примечаниях) некоторые сокращенные диалоги. <br><br> А сейчас, я могу заочно познакомить читателя с вторым по важности персонажем цикла. В этом романе ей уделено не так много эфирного времени, но всё еще только начинается… <br><br><div class="spoiler"> <b class="spoiler_title">Фрагмент</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> — Что ты такое? — задумчиво спросила я, всматриваясь в мутное видео. <br><br> Качество записи с борта МКС, мимо которой пролетел новый корабль, было отвратительным, но общую компоновку корабля разобрать было можно: корабль представлял собой узкую, пятнадцатиметровую колонну с маршевым двигателем, увенчанную широким, не меньше шести метров диаметром, цилиндром, всего в пару метров высоты. На цилиндре располагался пологий конус. Всё в сборе, выглядело очень по военному, словно выведенная в космос огромная граната для гранатомета. <br><br> — Во время разработки эта концепция называлась Starliner, а точнее CST-100. Разработан Боингом, в рамках программы развития коммерческих пилотируемых кораблей, организованной и финансируемой НАСА. Но, судя по тому, что мы видим, концепция корабля сильно изменилась — выйдя на орбиту корабль, не отстрелил свою вторую ступень, которая была дозаправлена при помощи двух Илоновых драконов. По нашим расчетам, топлива с запасом хватит для выхода на окололунную орбиту. <br><br> — И как называется этот жесткий маленький кораблик? <br><br> — USS Defiant. <br><br> — Опа, а чё он такой дерзкий? — пошутила я, в безуспешной попытке разогнать скребущих на душе кошек. <br><br> — Команду корабля возглавляет Миссисипи Траут, — продолжал нагнетать ОО, — Боюсь, что это плохая новость. Траут очень хитрая и расчетливая немка, известная своей способностью переть к цели не считаясь со средствами. <br><br> — Немка? Я видела в новостях эту коричневую куколку. И что в ней, простите, немецкого? Кроссовки Адидас? <br><br> — В школе нашу Миссисипи звали Хельга Шрёдер. Имя и фамилию она сменила при поступлении в Массачусетский технологический. <br><br>  - Yeah. И внешность она тоже сменила, вместе с этносом. Я же говорю, что видела эту мисс помесь. Чистокровная BAME. Расшифровать аббревиатурку? Это Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic — смешать, но не взбалтывать. <br><br> — … вместо тысячи слов, — пробурчал ОО, пересылая мне фотку, — Это Хельга на выпускном балу. <br><br> — Божечки-кошечки, — только и смогла сказать я, — Что с ней случилось-то? <br><br> С присланной ОО фотографии на меня смотрела худенькая светло-русая блондинка с правильными чертами лица и серыми глазами. При определенном умственном усилии можно было узнать в ней Миссисипи Траут, но, что за чёртовы горки так укатали сивку? <br><br> — С Хельгой случился пептидный гормон меланокортин. Не натуральный, конечно, а синтетический аналог от Neo Labs Ltd. Гормон этот стимулирует и усиливает загар кожи посредством стимулирования выработки пигмента меланина. <br><br> — Судя по тому, что я вижу, она жрала его ложками. Но не суть — техническая сторона мне понятна. Девушка перекрасилась, — подумав, сказала я. — А смысл? <br><br> — Хельга участвовала в медицинских тестах этого гормона. Производители считали что гормон может являться хорошей профилактикой меланомы. Это совпало с поступлением Хельги в вуз. И там она, возможно ради хайпа, а может и с далеко идущими планами, назвалась Миссисипи Траут. <br><br> — Так просто? <br><br> — Ты не в курсе современных реалий нации фастфуда, Даша. Маленькую миси спросили: её ли это имя? Она сказала что её, и что она назвала так сама себя, в честь выдающих афросестёр. Этот козырь ничем не перекрыть. Бито. <br><br> — Это всё еще ответ на вопрос «Как?», когда я спрашивала «Зачем?». <br><br> — Ты не представляешь, Даша, в какую жопу загнала политкорректность штатные федеральные агентства, когда с них требуют реальные достижения, а им по штату положено набрать определенный процент женщин, трансгендеров, цисгендеров, пансексуалов и нацменьшинств. <br><br> — Прекрасно понимаю. У нас, в Россиюшке, те же яйца, только в профиль — вместо политкорректной солянки сборной, у нас сборная солянка из дочек чиновников, сынуль депутатов и детишек смотрящих от кавказских кланов. И ничего — как-то работаем. В отдел нанимают пару человек с улицы, которые и тянут всю работу, за существенно меньший оклад. Газпромстайл. <br><br> — Это сработает только в случае, если работу на теневых сотрудников можно перевалить в принципе. Что не всегда выходит. И с НАСА именно тот случай — теневого исполнителя вместо квотированной дуры в космос не пошлешь. Так что НАСА схватилась за миси Миссисипи обеими руками. А Миссисипи схватилась за НАСА, так как с детства бредила космосом. Вынужденный союз при полном непротивлении сторон. <br><br> — Опасная штучка, — подумав, согласилась я. — Женщина, способная ради полета в космос отказаться от собственной расовой идентичности далеко пойдет. А что у неё на личном фронте? — спросила я, вспомнив уроки Посредника о том, что наиболее полно человек раскрывается в семейной жизни. <br><br> — Феерический 3.14здец, — радостно отозвался ОО, словно был, по меньшей мере, творцом упомянутого 3.14здеца, — Она жената вот на этом, — тут он переслал мне фотку страшной бабищи. Огромная, мужиковатая тетка больше всего походила на накрашенного качка в женском платье. <br><br> — Мать моя женщина, — согласилась я. — А это точно не переодетый мужик? — с сарказмом добавила я, разглядев огромный, словно Монблан, кадык. <br><br> — Бинго, Даша. Это школьный бой-френд Хельги, капитан школьной команды по регби. Читает шевеля губами, но хороший, надежный парень. Правильный. Он объявил о смене пола, чтоб дать подруге дополнительный бонус в штатной табели о рангах. Мисс Миссисипи теперь официальная лесбиянка. <br><br> — То есть эта ушлая немка считается афроамериканской лесбиянкой, хотя родилась белой и живет с мужиком? Хитро. А настоящие феминистические афролесби не понимают, что она пасется на их лужке? <br><br> — Настоящих афролесбиянок не спрашивают, Даша. Они часть дискурса, а не его владельцы. <br><br> Я замолчала, обдумывая услышанное. Хиханьки хаханьками, но это назначение пованивало. Хельга была слишком удобной козой отпущения, чтоб оставить этот аспект вне поля анализа. В случае чего — от неё с радостью отвернутся все: и белые и лесбиянки и негры… <br><br> — Интересно было бы спросить, что нашла наша бредящая космосом дева в этой полицейской операции? <br><br> — Она слишком немка, Дарья, чтоб отказаться. Ordnung muss sein — порядок должен соблюдаться. Хельга готовилась к запланированному НАСА полету в астероидный пояс. В полицаи её забрил Трамп, не спрашивая её мнения. <br><br> «Не лезь, дура, она тебя сожрёт» — захотелось мне крикнуть Хельге, по поводу её безоговорочного сотрудничества с государственной машиной. При этом я прекрасно понимала, что Хельга, даже услышав меня, не поймет сказанного. Чему нас история и учит, так только тому, что история ничему никого не учит. <br><br> — Что-то страшное грядёт, — сказала вслух я, — Добром это не кончится. <br><br> — Ну, не все так плохо, Дарья, — делано весело отозвался ОО, — Не забывай про фактор Китая. Штатам воевать не с руки, так что всё ограничиться бряцаньем оружием. Миссия Миссисипи — сохранение лица Трампа. Что-то вроде марш-броска на Приштину от ЕБН — для внутренней пропаганды можно назвать это победой, а на внешние отношения это никак не повлияет, поскольку сей демарш бессмыслен и бесполезен. <br><br> — Твои слова да богу в уши, — поддакнула я, не веря сама себе. Как в воду глядела, если что. <br></div></div><br><br></div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/437938/">https://habr.com/ru/post/437938/</a></p>
