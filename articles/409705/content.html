<div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, Giktayms!  Life does not become simpler, and mobile computers do not become more functional.  Rather, on the contrary - every year, manufacturers find in them another connector that can be removed for the sake of "more premium user experience."  Now it is necessary to restore the ports with the help of USB hubs of varying degrees of "nonnameness".  But now you can buy a model without the "Chinese lottery" - welcome Kingston Nucleum and consider how much useful you can fit into the case with the dimensions of a button telephone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tf/8g/3g/tf8g3go5ubeufhjnzzpusqhbfda.jpeg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8000c">The magnificent era of "you do not need it" in computers</font> </h2><br>  If laptops with narrowed side faces without connectors are sitting in your livers, now is the best time to say hello to those who opened the fashion for such mobile computers.  Because 10 years ago the Apple MacBook Air was born, in which (oh, horror!) There was no optical drive, the battery was not removable, there was no network connector at all, and there was only one USB port.  As history has shown, this is exactly what customers have been lacking for so long, because today the minimum number of ports and low-voltage processors (which have just become suitable for serious workload) have become the hallmark of mass mobile PCs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jp/vb/g8/jpvbg8lpy-0zv_hpa86uqzv0vmu.jpeg"><br>  <i>Today, even the port set of the classic MacBook Air looks extensive.</i> <br><br>  Industrial computers suffered from such a fashion to a lesser extent (although they appeared to have “docking stations for everything”), but mass laptops changed beyond recognition — they dramatically added autonomy, became much more compact, but a set of connectors to “sit down” and start working "lost forever.  But for every action there is a reaction, and just about him today will be discussed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dg/ss/38/dgss38u0bw2ddsor8xf6jy1spo4.jpeg"><br>  <i>When they came to the ports in the 12-inch MacBook, I was silent - I had a MacBook Pro ...</i> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8000c">Displays, drives, charging</font> </h2><br>  Laptops can be used as a typewriter for essays, an enlarged smartphone with a keyboard (and once everyone thought it would be the other way around, and smartphones would become “mobile computers”) or as a working tool.  Yes, no one is going to release three revisions of one model for a different audience, so you have to buy a universal laptop, and then modify it with a “file” for your own use case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6x/-p/xd/6x-pxdf-q_130gpz_a9qwkxo5hi.jpeg"><br>  <i>Kingston Nucleum fully armed</i> <br><br>  “Kulibins”, of course, will not agree, but it’s difficult to fight head-on with a symbolic number of ports and the lack of a card reader in new ultrabooks - almost nobody decides to unwrap additional USB on the motherboard and produce holes for them in the aluminum case.  Therefore, multifunctional USB hubs come to the rescue - outlandish boxes stuffed with a record number of connectors to the housing area.  Take a look at the brand new Kingston Nucleum, which has: <br><br>  - New-fashioned <b>USB-C 3.1 Gen 1</b> connector for data transfer (up to 5 Gbit / s) <br>  - Two classic <b>USB-A 3.1 Gen 1</b> connectors for data transfer (up to 5 Gbps).  They give power 5V 1.5A - enough to recharge any smartphone. <br>  - <b>Card reader</b> for full-size <b>SD-cards (SD / SDHC / SDXC)</b> with high-speed limits UHS-I-II. <br>  - <b>Card reader</b> for microSD <b>cards (microSD, microSDHC, microSDXC)</b> with high-speed limits UHS-I. <br>  - <b>HDMI</b> video <b>output</b> with support for 4K resolution (v1.4). <br>  - <b>USB-C</b> connector with support for <b>Power Delivery</b> technology for powering peripherals and charging a laptop (up to <b>60 W</b> ). <br>  <s>Three tape recorders</s> <s><br></s>  <s>Three movie cameras overseas</s> <s><br></s>  <s>Three cigarette case domestic</s> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wa/jt/fz/wajtfz_i1jnxj0iiunikdmftjb4.jpeg"><br><br>  Thus, in a small case (127 x 45 x 14.2 mm without cable), a 7-in-1 hub is located, which is able to simultaneously transfer data from a hard disk, two smartphones and charge them, and at the same time charge your laptop while You are busy working on two displays.  “Desktop Package Options” from a single USB-C port in a laptop!  And the video output to a monitor with HDMI support from a “typewriter” with a single connector, which is almost always busy charging, is a pleasant circumstance.  Moreover, for work tasks and viewing video specifications HDMI 1.4 is more than enough even for 4K resolution.  Is that the RJ-45 in the hub is not, although to catch Wi-Fi in the room today is much easier than to find a patchcord. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qx/u-/lb/qxu-lbkzyp28_vycu7dwz-xvdk4.jpeg"><br>  <i>Each of the USB-A ports is able to quickly charge the smartphone</i> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8000c">“My noname USB hub is your USB hub!”</font> </h2><br>  When, in response to the news "Kingston releases a USB hub", readers expect a record number of connectors or sensational innovations that are ahead of their time, such faith in the company is always pleasant.  But even according to the “parent” brand Kingston, one can guess that Nucleum does not pretend to be extreme (HyperX is responsible for this), and that it has another task. <br><br>  There is no problem to find an existing hub in nature, which is packed with all the common ports in the PC of the last quarter of a century.  Problems begin when one connected memory card “paralyzes” the work of the other card reader connectors at the hardware level.  Or when the image / sound starts to disappear in the monitor, because the hard disk in the neighborhood transfers data too intensively, because of which the microcircuit inside the hub overheats.  When there is no use of a platoon of USB ports, because they are too close to each other, and the wireless mouse is unstable, because USB 3.0 ports interfere with the 2.4 GHz transmitter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8e/jn/wy/8ejnwygt0ctrjtq2ts2m1ereiiw.jpeg"><br><br>  For all these problems, sellers in Chinese online stores will answer, “Dear friend!  I do not know and do not want to know - the ports are operational, the hub, in general, is healthy.  Happiness to you and your family!  If you are completely unbearable, send the hub back to us, and then we will return the money spent on it! ”.  No one cares about the details in the implementation of the product, if we are talking about extremely cheap "noname". <br><br>  Kingston has a different approach to work, and he is well known to everyone.  Even from the first modules of RAM, this approach sounded like “more affordable than unreasonably expensive original components, but without compromise in quality of manufacture”.  For this reason, Kingston's memory was purchased for branded PCs (in which components were previously marked strictly by one manufacturer) instead of the standard one.  And guided by the same logic, the company released Nucleum - a trouble-free compact USB hub, in which everything works, “as it should” and is cheaper than the pathetic “court” components of mobile PC manufacturers. <br><br>  Subscribe and stay with us - it will be interesting! <br><br>  For more information about <b>Kingston</b> and <b>HyperX</b> products, visit <a href="http://www.kingston.com/ru">the company's official website</a> . </div>
