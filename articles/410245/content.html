At a certain point, it became clear that in the current office there is too little space for everything that we would like to see there.  We decided to move the service department, service engineers and part of the warehouse to a new room, and began to look for the right one.  The task was not as simple as we thought. <br><br>  <b>How to search</b> <br><br>  After studying a lot of ads on rental sites, we chose the right ones and started calling the landlords.  The first calls showed that no one is following the information on the websites, and the prices are very approximate. <br><br>  The first trips upset even more - most of the rooms only vaguely resembled those that were shown in the photographs.  Since we are also engaged in industrial equipment, we needed a gate at least two meters wide so that we could import and export machines.  Finding a room with such a gate and a rental price of no more than 500 rubles per square meter per month was not immediately possible - they were not there anywhere. <br><br>  There were problems with the location.  It was impossible to get to some of the premises by public transport, others were located in remote industrial zones, and some were located inside the ethnic communities inhabiting Moscow.  After a month of active searches, the premises were found and there was a need to adapt it to our tasks, since inside we were waiting for bare walls. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dc/gj/-u/dcgj-u4028j970bve_3hon9uoh4.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Arrangement</b> <br><br>  What we wanted to see in the new house of our department of services: a room for processing machines, a separate room for service engineers, a room for painting equipment, a small warehouse for service and a main warehouse for equipment, and in addition a room for meals and recreation for employees. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yc/oc/gh/ycocghtmzzaerl4gexh2ay4ryh4.jpeg"><br><br>  When planning it was necessary to take into account many factors, such as: location for the loader, the maximum size of the box for delivery to the warehouse, the location of the supply and exhaust ventilation, heating, power supply. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xt/87/ey/xt87ey0umd0zx4lbqnnttktfhum.jpeg"><br><br>  We began by drawing on the floor the approximate location of future walls, once again checked how it meets all our requirements, transferred the planned walls to paper and began to choose a contractor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jc/qk/6d/jcqk6dmusakjbzxxmuaanlwcpjc.jpeg"><br><br>  On the intricacies of choosing a construction company - in the conclusions at the end of the article. <br>  Furniture and equipment began to be delivered before the end of the repair. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jg/fe/0r/jgfe0r1zv3siklqxxvwlzo9qheo.jpeg"><br><br>  The premises had to be repaired in a short time, since a truck with cargo had already arrived at customs, and the service department was sitting on suitcases ready for the move. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mj/ci/ov/mjciovscbewx5aryylc3gffsnvm.jpeg"><br><br>  Despite the objective factors that delay repair time - for example - the need to dry each layer during painting, the time was maintained. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/09/du/f9/09duf9nyllds1tnfobgkyds9ams.jpeg"><br><br>  The room was prepared for the arrival of the next batch of goods.  We made a separate room where the spray booth will be installed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ui/b-/8l/uib-8l18ycg4mvny_4lctz23wce.jpeg"><br><br>  The room for the installation of milling machines is completely isolated from the rest of the premises, to eliminate the ingress of dust into them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hp/r4/vb/hpr4vb0zy-spivfkpnkfrltgyh0.jpeg"><br><br>  Repair work took about two weeks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uu/yz/zt/uuyzztjh5i1ezwwxai0krrvlsm4.jpeg"><br><br>  Very lucky with ventilation.  Contrary to the lessorâ€™s claims, it turned out to be completely working, and all that was needed was to connect the sleeves and install some plugs.  It saved a good amount and time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u6/ap/tz/u6aptz0grd_yu9bqtjwhfcls4kc.jpeg"><br><br>  The landlord generally got merry: at the time when the interior partitions were already installed, he said that they could not be mounted, since the inspection from the BTI would be very unhappy and they would demolish everything.  Later it became clear that this was a kind of display of a sense of humor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/li/83/j5/li83j5ilxlxwatt7-qdw8u-lxnm.jpeg"><br><br>  Mounted fire and burglar alarms in accordance with all standards, not only in case of the arrival of checks, but also because they are really needed in any industrial premises.  Wireless smoke, temperature and motion detectors - all up-to-date. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3k/fh/aa/3kfhaadmcw1119kcohexaodmaim.jpeg"><br><br>  Equipped room maintenance

<br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/y1/zn/ni/y1znnijbfyu5zo3y3_bcvppghok.jpeg"><br><br>  The search for a suitable production facility in Moscow presents certain difficulties.  In full growth there are questions of cost and location, to find a suitable place is not easy.  Bringing the place found in working condition is even more difficult. <br><br>  The main difficulty is the choice of a contractor who is ready to perform the required amount of work for adequate money.  The range of prices for such work in Moscow - from 0.5 million, to 1.5 million rubles - this should be taken into account and chosen carefully, so as not to overpay, but not to hire anyone.  Careful and thoughtful searches allowed us to find an acceptable option - we spent only 300,000 rubles, while receiving a decent quality of work. <br><br>  The second important point: in construction - no advances, only a phased payment.  At the coordination stage, several other companies fell off, they were not ready to work under such a scheme. <br><br>  And the third - mandatory warranty.  We chose a contractor who gives a year warranty on the work performed. <br><br>  We managed to find a room, rent it and equip it for work, as soon as possible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-y/ls/mp/-ylsmpq5tt1cuxv5hrj4fjyekyw.jpeg"><br><br>  We wish the same to all who set themselves a similar task. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mv/cd/g4/mvcdg44ql0owiq4xq3bqkpennrq.jpeg"><br><br>  Our service department is glad to welcome everyone to the new address: Balaklavsky Ave., 28A Building 2, you can arrange a visit by calling +7 (499) 322-23-19.
